Tell me if this code penalises a player for relying too much on say putting in play
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Yes—there’s an explicit “hot‐stat” penalty built in. After you enter your four SG components (off‐tee, approach, around‐green, putting), the code computes:

# inside imbalance_penalty()
vec = np.array([sg_off, sg_app, sg_agrn, sg_putt])
total = vec.sum()
shares = vec / total
hhi = (shares**2).sum()
penalty = max(0.0, hhi - baseline) * scale
HHI (Herfindahl–Hirschman Index)
This sums the squares of each component’s share of total SG. If one skill (e.g. putting) dominates, its share² drives HHI up.

Baseline & scale
You subtract a baseline concentration (default 0.30), then multiply by a scale (default 20), so only “excess” concentration is penalized.

Applied in score
That penalty is subtracted in the overall score calculation:

score = … + (sg_off+sg_app+sg_putt+sg_agrn)*0.5 - score_penalty
So yes—if you rely disproportionately on putting (or any single SG component), the imbalance penalty will kick in and lower your model score.

You said:
tell me how the model works, is it looking at pre-tournament stats and in play stats to come up with a fair price
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
The model combines both pre‑tournament (“book” or season­t‑long) data and in‑play (live tournament) information to arrive at a “fair” lay price. Here’s the step‑by‑step:

1. Pre‑tournament inputs (“Book” stats)
Seasonal SG metrics

SG Off‐Tee, Approach, Around‑the‑Green, Putting: your strokes‑gained components.

SG True vs SG Expected: season‑to‑date performance vs what’s typical for your ranking.

Total Shots Gained, Putt, T2G: raw totals.

Course & form

Course Fit (0–1): how well your game maps to this course.

Ranking & Last 5 Finishes: measures of current form.

“Expected Wins” (xwins): panel‑based preseason win projections.

All of these feed into a single composite score (0–100), via a weighted sum (including a penalty if your strokes‑gained are too heavily skewed toward one skill).

score = 50 
    + xwins 
    + 0.5*(total_shots + putt + T2G) 
    + pressure_term 
    + course_fit*100 
    – 0.5*ranking 
    – 0.3*leaderboard_pos 
    – 0.5*avg_last5 
    + 0.5*sum(SG_components) 
    – imbalance_penalty
    – small_shots_diff_adjustment
That score is then shoved through a logistic function

​
 
(with a floor at 2%).

2. In‑play projection via Monte Carlo
Once the tournament is underway, you supply:

Holes Left

Shots Diff: your stroke advantage/disadvantage to the field leader.

Live Odds & Leaderboard Position

The code projects your remaining strokes‑gained pace (a blend of expected SG and your round‑so‑far rate) and then simulates thousands of finishes against a field of N contenders:

p_sim = simulate_win_prob(shots_diff, holes_left, sg_remaining, contenders)
This yields an in‑play win probability based on your current Strokes‑Gained trajectory and the amount of golf yet to play.

3. Blending & “Fair” price
Blend the two probabilities:

giving you a “fair” lay price that’s partly driven by the live market itself.

4. Lay‑bet sizing & EV
Finally, if there’s positive edge (above a small threshold), it:

Computes a lay liability via a Kelly‑style fraction of your bankroll.

 (LiveOdds−1)
In short
Pre‑tournament stats build a baseline “model” win‑prob via a weighted composite score → logistic transform.

In‑play stats (holes left, stroke differential, live SG pace) feed a Monte Carlo simulation → live win‑prob.

Those two are blended, compared to the market, and turned into a “fair” lay price + staking plan.

You said:
why isn't sg putting, ott, arg etc being used
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
While you do enter all four Strokes‑Gained components (Off‑Tee, Approach, Around‑the‑Green, Putting), the core win‑prob and lay‑price engines don’t treat them as four separate inputs—instead they’re collapsed into two things:

The raw “score”

You get +0.5×(sg_off+sg_app+sg_agrn+sg_putt) as one lump term

You also pay an imbalance penalty if one of those four dominates (via the HHI formula).
So your individual SG figures only matter in aggregate and to check you aren’t a one‑trick pony.

The in‑play Monte Carlo projection

It needs a single “strokes‑gained remaining” rate, not four separate rates.

The code computes

t2g_h = (sg_off + sg_app + sg_agrn) / holes_played  
putt_h = sg_putt / holes_played  
rate_h = 0.8*t2g_h + 0.2*putt_h  
and then blends that with your pre‑tournament SG expectation to get sg_rem, which drives the simulations.

If you want the model to weight—or simulate—each SG component separately (say, modelling putting variance differently from ball‑striking), you’d need to replace that single‑rate approach with a multivariate simulation. The current design trades off dimensionality for simplicity by using:

Sum of SGs (minus imbalance) in the logistic “model”

Weighted average SG pace in the Monte Carlo

…and so your raw sg_off, sg_app, sg_agrn and sg_putt feed in only through those two aggregates.

You said:
do we need to do this or is it ok as is
ChatGPT said:
It really depends on your priorities and data availability:

Keep it as-is if you value:
Simplicity & Interpretability

One aggregated SG “pace” number is easy to explain to a coach or trader.

Fewer parameters means less risk of overfitting—especially if you don’t have tons of in‑tournament SG splits.

Computational Efficiency

A single Monte Carlo on overall strokes‑gained runs in milliseconds; separate sims for four components would be orders of magnitude heavier.

Robustness

You already guard against over‑reliance on any one skill via the HHI imbalance penalty.

Blending season‑long expectations with live pace smooths out component noise.

Consider breaking them out if you need:
Component‑Specific Variance Modeling

Putting has far higher round‑to‑round volatility than off‑tee or approach. If you think its variance profile drives your edge, simulating it separately could improve accuracy.

Course‑or‑Tour‑Specific Effects

Some venues punish poor ball‑striking far more than bad putting. Modeling SG_off, SG_app, SG_putt and SG_agrn individually lets you bake in course sensitivities.

Data‑Driven Feature Importance

If you have historical data, you can run a feature‑importance analysis (e.g. tree‑based model) to see if, say, SG_putt adds incremental predictive power beyond your aggregate pace.

Bottom line
Your current approach is a great balance of speed, interpretability, and performance—especially if you’re already seeing good calibration and stable edges in live trading. You only “need” finer SG splits if you have:

Sufficient high‑resolution in‑tournament data to estimate separate component variances reliably, and

A clear hypothesis that, for your use‑case (e.g. course‑specific lays), component‑level variance actually changes your lay edge materially.

Otherwise, leave it as is—monitor your back‑test and live P&L, and revisit only if you spot systematic mispricing that a more granular SG model could plausibly fix.

You said:
but if a putter is hot compared to other SG areas the player will be penalised
ChatGPT said:
Exactly—any time one SG component (like putting) makes up a disproportionately large share of your total strokes‑gained, the HHI‑based penalty will kick in. Here’s the quick logic:

Compute shares:

share
i

∑

​
 =

​
 
Penalty:

(
0
,
  
HHI
−
0.30
)
  
×
  
20
max(0,HHI−0.30)×20
So if putting (or any one skill) makes up more than √0.30≈55% of your total SG, you start taking points off your composite score.

Why it’s there
Discourages “one‑trick ponies”: A player who’s purely a hot putter but can’t hit or approach greens reliably is less likely to sustain a tournament win.

Balances risk: Over‑reliance on a high‑variance skill (like hot putting) can lead to big swings.

Options
Leave as is: If you’re comfortable penalizing one‑dimensional performances.

Tweak sensitivity: You can raise the baseline (e.g. from 0.30 to 0.35) or lower the scale (from 20 to, say, 10) to soften the penalty.

Let me know if you’d like guidance on adjusting those parameters!

is the monte carlo sim adjusting for number of holes left, contenders and how strong the field is
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Yes—here’s exactly how the Monte Carlo sim accounts for those factors:

Holes remaining

md = - (sg_expect_round * holes_left / 18)
sd = rnd_sd * sqrt(holes_left / 18)
Mean (md) scales your expected strokes‑gained per hole by the fraction of the round left.

Std‑dev (sd) grows with √(holes_left/18), so more holes → more variance.

Number of contenders

oth = np.random.normal(0, sd, size=(sims, contenders-1))
You simulate contenders‑1 opponents each round.

More opponents → lower chance your “you.min() ≤ their.min()” condition is met.

Field “strength”

You choose the contenders argument via the Field Quality menu:

FIELD_CONTENDERS = {"weak":30, "average":70, "strong":120}
quality = quality_var.get()  # "weak"/"average"/"strong"
p_sim = simulate_win_prob(..., FIELD_CONTENDERS[quality])
This is a crude proxy for strength—stronger fields simply have more players.

Note: All opponents are drawn from the same N(0, sd) distribution, so you’re not modeling a higher‑skill population with a better mean or lower variance—only more of them.

If you want a finer field‑strength adjustment
Vary the opponents’ mean (e.g. draw from N(μ>0, sd) for stronger fields).

Use a lower sd for top players (less round‑to‑round volatility).

Simulate separate SG components for opponents rather than a single aggregate.

But as‑written, the sim does adjust for holes left and number of opponents; it just treats “strength” purely as head‑count.

using my model if i'm betting end of rounds, what are the best odds brackets to target each round
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14 seconds
Roughly speaking, because your Monte Carlo win‐prob ramps up as holes disappear, the live odds at which you flip from negative to positive expected value will move inwards each round. A practical rule of thumb is:

Round	Holes Left	Rough Live Win Prob (p_sim)	Approx. p_final<br>(25%×25% + 75%×p_sim)	EV‑Neutral Odds = 1/p_final	Odds Bracket to Target
End R1	54	~5 %	0.0625	16.0	15×–30×
End R2	36	~10 %	0.1375	7.3	8×–15×
End R3	18	~20 %	0.2125	4.7	4.5×–8×
How we get these brackets
Estimate p_sim

Early (54 holes): even a good player only has ~5 % win chances in a big field.

Mid (36 holes): run‐rate improvements bump that to ~10 %.

Late (18 holes): you’ve established form, so ~20 %.

Pick a bracket just above that neutral‐EV line to give yourself some cushion and liquidity:

After R2: neutral around 7.3× ⇒ focus on 8–15×

After R3: neutral around 4.7× ⇒ focus on 4.5–8×

A few caveats
These are ballpark ranges based on typical p_sim values—your actual p_sim may be higher or lower depending on the player and course.

You’ll still want to check edge = p_final – (1/LiveOdds) before sizing any lay.

Don’t forget to apply your hedge percentages (the code’s recommended_hedge_pct) once you’ve picked your odds.

But as a round‑by‑round workflow, this 15–30, 8–15, 4–8 progression will capture the sweet‑spot where your blended model most often finds positive EV.

so end of r2 i can target odds 8 -15 but if i can lay under 7.3 and model is -ev this is perfect is that what you mean
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
You’ve got the idea, but let me untangle the two use‑cases:

1. Opening a new lay (seeking +EV)
At the end of R2 our blended break‑even (EV‑neutral) is about 7.3×.

If you can lay at higher than 7.3 (say 8–15×), your lay has positive EV
(because your model thinks the true probability is higher than the market is implying).

That’s why we suggest targeting the 8×–15× bracket for new lays after 36 holes.

2. Hedging an existing back (locking in profit)
Once you’ve backed pre‑tournament, you’ll want to lay at a lower price than your break‑even to guarantee a profit.

If the market drifts below 7.3× later on, your lay is at negative‑EV in model terms—but that’s exactly what you want for a hedge, since you’re taking the other side to lock in gains.

So:

To initiate a new lay: wait for odds above ~7.3 (ideally 8–15×).

To hedge a back: lay when odds fall below ~7.3.

Hope that clears it up!

You said:
I'm never backing but are you saying i shouldn't lay under 8 end of r2?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Exactly—if you’re only ever laying and never hedging/backing, you should only open new lays when the market odds exceed your break‑even, which at the end of R2 is about 7.3×.

So in practice you’d:

Wait for odds ≥ 8× (our “8–15×” bracket) to ensure positive EV on the lay.

Avoid laying at anything under ~7.3×, since that would be a negative‑EV trade.

(Those numbers are rounded guides—your exact break‑even is 1∕p_final for the specific player and conditions—so always check the model’s p_final before pulling the trigger.)

Because 2.86 > 2.50, you’re laying at a price above your break‑even ⇒ positive EV, so you should lay.

TL;DR
Use 1/p_final for your true break‑even each time.

The 4.7× figure was just the average BE for a 21% model‐win chance.

If 1/p_final is below the current odds, go ahead and lay—even if it’s under 4.7×.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9 seconds
Waiting until the next‑morning snapshot is perfectly fine—provided your model is still showing a healthy edge at that time—but you need to understand the trade‑off:

Execution vs. drift risk

Lay immediately when your player has just finished, and you lock in the maximum edge you spot. Odds can only tighten (EV erodes) or drift out (EV grows).

Wait until morning and you give up whatever edge might have existed at finish; if the market instead tightens overnight, you’ll be sitting on a smaller or even a negative edge.

Using a 3 % edge threshold

If, first thing in the morning (≈5 h before next round), your model still shows ≥ 3 % edge, then yes—you’re guaranteed positive‑EV lays at that point.

But that 3 % has to cover both the pure EV you want and a “delay premium” for the risk that odds could tighten further before your execution.

Practical suggestion

Decide on a minimum edge buffer. If you’re comfortable losing up to, say, 1 % of edge by waiting, then only go ahead in the morning if your model shows ≥ 4 % edge (so you net ≥ 3 % after potential drift).

Monitor typical overnight moves. If, historically, odds drift in your favor 60 % of the time by +1–2 %, waiting makes sense; if not, you’ll want a higher “go‑rate” threshold.

TL;DR
You don’t have to lay under 4.7× at end‑R3 if today your model still shows > 0 EV at whatever odds you observe tomorrow morning.

But by waiting you forfeit any edge that was there immediately post‑round and expose yourself to odds tightening.

To be safe, raise your minimum‑edge cutoff above 3 % (e.g. to 4–5 %) if you plan always to wait until UK morning.

You said:
but if the odds tighten i'm then laying at a better price for me?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Not quite—“tightening” in odds‐speak means the numbers get smaller (e.g. from 10× down to 8×). For a lay, that’s worse, not better:

Laying at higher odds (say 10×) means you’re effectively selling at a lower implied probability (0.10), which gives you more edge if your model thinks the true win‑chance is higher.

If odds tighten to, say, 8×, the implied probability jumps to 1/8 = 12.5%. You’d now be laying at a price that implies a higher win‑probability, so your edge (model p – implied p) shrinks or even goes negative.

In other words:

Odds	Implied p = 1/Odds	If model p_final = 0.20	Edge = p_final – implied p
10×	0.10	0.20	+0.10
8×	0.125	0.20	+0.075
7.3×	0.137	0.20	+0.063
So if you wait until the morning and the market has tightened (odds have shortened), you’re laying at a worse price (lower odds), giving you less EV than you’d have gotten immediately post‑round.

What you actually want if you wait
Odds drift out (go longer)—that’s when you’d pick up extra EV by laying later.

Odds tighten—you lose EV relative to the post‑round snapshot.

Practical tip
If you plan to wait overnight but only want to lay if the price is still ≥ your break‑even, put in a limit order for a lay at that minimum odds (1/p_final). That way:

If the market drifts out (better for you), your lay executes automatically.

If it tightens below your threshold, you simply don’t get matched—so you never lay at a negative‑EV price.

I'd laid a golfer at 8.2 when his round finished, he's now this morning at 5.6. that's bad surely if'd waitied i could lay him at a better price less liability if he's still shwoing as having a negative edge on my model
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
You’ve just run into exactly the risk of waiting for the “morning” snapshot: when you laid at 8.2× you locked in the maximum EV your model was offering at that moment. By waiting, the market tightened to 5.6×, which:

Shrinks your EV

At 8.2× your implied p = 1/8.2≈12.2%.

If your model thought the true p_final was, say, 20%, your edge was +7.8%.

At 5.6× the implied p = 17.9%. If p_final is still 20%, your edge collapses to +2.1%.

Increases required stake for a given liability

Laying £1 at 8.2× risks £7.20 liability (odds–1).

Laying £1 at 5.6× risks £4.60 liability.

To keep the same £7.20 liability at 5.6×, you’d have to lay ~£1.57. That’s more money on the table, even though your EV per £ is smaller.

So what could you have done?
Use a limit/conditional order at your break‑even or better (e.g. only lay if odds ≥ 8.2).

If the market drifts out past 8.2× while you sleep, you get matched automatically.

If it tightens (as happened), you don’t get matched and avoid laying at a worse price.

Raise your minimum edge threshold if you’re always going to wait.

Say you require ≥ 5% edge at snapshot + 1% “waiting risk,” so you only lay in the morning if your model shows ≥ 6% edge at whatever odds prevail then.

Bottom line
Laying at 5.6× is strictly worse than laying at 8.2× if your model p_final hasn’t moved.

To preserve the upside of waiting (hoping for even longer odds) without the downside of getting stuck at shorter odds, use conditional lays at your target price or edge level.

ChatGPT said:

If Edge > 0, you’re still in +EV territory, so mathematically you can leave the lay open.

If Edge < 0, you’ve flipped to a negative‑EV position and should close it by backing at 5.6×.

2. Locking in profit vs. chasing extra EV
Close it now (back at 5.6×):

Locks in the profit you’ve already built (you sold at 8.2×, you’re buying back at 5.6×).

Removes all further variance: you won’t gain or lose on next round.

Leave it open:

If your p

​
  still exceeds 17.9%, you expect more EV over the next round, but with all the usual tournament volatility.

You’re exposed to swings—if the player surges, you lose your lay; if they crater, you win.

3. A simple rule of thumb
Automatic hedge: Place a back order at 5.6× for exactly the liability you currently have. If the market tightens further, you get filled and lock in profit; if it drifts back out above 5.6×, your order simply doesn’t execute and you keep the open lay for more EV.

Edge buffer: If you plan to leave it open only when you still see a healthy buffer (say ≥ 3–5% edge), require that p

If it’s still > 17.9% (+EV), you may leave the lay open.

If it’s ≤ 17.9% (–EV), close it by backing at current odds (5.6×) to lock in what remains of your profit.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7 seconds
Your model is now telling you that Jake Knapp has a 9.9 % chance of winning, but the market at 5.9× is implying 16.9 %. That’s an edge of –7.1 %, so you’re running a negative‑EV lay.

Your options
Close out entirely

Place a back bet at the current price (5.9×) for whatever liability you’ve got on Knapp.

This locks in the remaining profit (or caps your loss) and removes all further tournament variance.

Partial hedge

Your model actually suggested a 60 % hedge at this stage (the “Lay Hedge %” column).

You could back ~£0.43 (60 % of your liability) at 5.9× to lock in most of your gains, then leave the remaining 40 % of the lay open for a small tilt at a recovery.

Leave it open

Only makes sense if you believe the market will drift back out (odds rising above ~8.65, your “Fair” odds) and you’re comfortable carrying a negative‑EV position in the meantime.

Otherwise you’re just gambling on reversal.

What I’d do
Since you’re getting negative EV on the remaining slice, the pure‑model play is to close it (or at least hedge according to your 60 % recommendation) and move on. That way you lock in what’s left of your profit instead of eroding it further.

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 26 seconds
You’re still sitting on a +EV lay here, so from an EV‑maximization standpoint you should leave it on (and certainly not close it at 5.9×). Here’s the quick breakdown:

 	 Value 
Model p_final	 9.87 % 
Market p_mkt=1/5.9	 16.95 % 
Edge = p_final – p_mkt	 –7.08 % ⇒ negative edge ⇒ positive EV as a lay
“Break‑even” lay odds = 1/p_final	 ≈10.13× 
Model’s blended Fair odds = 8.65×	 – tells you where the market “should” be trading
Because the market (5.9×) is well below your break‑even (10.13×), laying is still +EV.

Closing now (backing at 5.9×) would lock in a sub‑optimal price and destroy that EV.

If you really wanted to dial in your sizing you could add a small extra lay (the model’s 50%‑Kelly formula spits out a liability of ~£0.72, i.e. a £0.15 stake at 5.9×), but you’ve already laid £10.10 of liability (0.5 @ 7.2 and 1 @ 8.0), so you’re actually over‑levered vs. the classic Kelly sizing.

So what to do?
Leave the two existing lays alone.

Do not close—you’ll only give up the remaining +EV.

Skip adding more unless you have a specific risk‑budget: you’re already beyond the model‑recommended size.

Re‑assess after the next round (when “holes left” changes) or if the market drifts back out toward your fair of ~8.65× (that would be an even better price to layer up again).

In short: hold your 7.2× and 8.0× lays into the next round, and only adjust if your updated model p_final or the market odds move into a totally different regime.

of expected profit (i.e. you’d actually lose EV by closing at 5.9×).

3. What about adding a fresh lay at 5.9×?
Your model still sees a fair price of 8.65× (≈11.6 % implied), so 5.9× (16.9 %) is another +EV slice:

Incremental EV on a 0.15 £ stake at 5.9× is roughly

)
×
0.15
≈
+
0.011
 
£
.
(0.169−0.0987)×0.15≈+0.011£.
It would nudge your average lay price down only slightly (from 7.75× to ≈7.63×) but still leave you well above your fair.

📌 Recommendation
Don’t close at 5.9×—that crystallizes a loss vs your entry prices.

You can add the small model‑recommended slice (0.15 £ at 5.9×) if you want every last drop of EV.

Or simply hold your two existing lays (7.2× & 8.0×) into the next round—both are still solidly positive‐EV positions.

Either way, do not back out at 5.9×. That’s a sub‑optimal price compared to your fair of 8.65×.

out of 2 and 3 which offers the best edge for me
ChatGPT said:

“Edge” in this context is simply the difference between the market’s implied win‑prob and your model’s win‑prob. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Position	Odds	Implied pₘₖₜ	Model p_final	Edge = pₘₖₜ–p_final
Lay @ 7.2×	7.2	13.89 %	9.87 %	+4.02 %
Lay @ 8.0×	8.0	12.50 %	9.87 %	+2.63 %
Hold total	—	—	—	≈3.03 % avg
New lay @ 5.9×	5.9	16.95 %	9.87 %	+7.08 %
Option 2 (add the 0.15 £ lay at 5.9×) gives you a 7.08 % edge, the highest of the three.

Option 3 (just hold your existing lays at 7.2× & 8.0×) is a blended ~3.0 % edge overall.

So if you’re purely chasing the largest edge, the new slice at 5.9× is the winner.

look at my current positions and how big they are, I have a £20 account overall and as this is testing I'm happy to be risking the whole account this weekend. This is end of R2 before R3, how much should I lay knapp for this morning
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14 seconds
At the current 5.9× price you already have £10.10 of liability on Knapp (0.5 @ 7.2× = £3.10, 1 @ 8.0× = £7.00), so if you truly want to risk your full £20 this weekend you can add up to £9.90 more of liability on him today.

Liability you can add:
20.00

10.10

That will bring your total lay liability on him to about £20 exactly.

New liability = 1 × (5.9–1) = £4.90

Total liability → 10.10 + 4.90 = £15.00

Reserve for R4 → £20.00 – £15.00 = £5.00

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14 seconds
At the moment your Betfair cash balance is £10.28 and your total liability on Knapp (from the two lays at 7.2 & 8.0) is £9.40, leaving you £0.88 of free margin to work with.

The best‐available lay price on Knapp this morning is 5.8×, so any new lay stake Δ you place will reserve Δ × (5.8–1) of liability. To fully use your £0.88 of free margin:

Δ
  
×
  
(
5.8

0.88
⟹

≈
  
£
0.18
Δ×(5.8−1)=0.88⟹Δ= 
4.8
0.88
​
 ≈£0.18
So:

Place a new lay of £0.18 at 5.8× on Knapp.

That will lock in an extra £0.86 of liability (0.18 × 4.8) and leave you fully deployed at about £10.26 total liability—just under your £10.28 balance.

If you’d rather save a little cushion for R4, simply size it smaller (e.g. £0.10 at 5.8× reserves £0.48 liability, leaving £0.40 free for tomorrow).

You said:
explain why this amount, is this to preserve capital to lay r4? Don't forget I'm happy to lose the entire £20 over the weekend while i'm testing don't treat this like it's a full balance that i have to keep
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7 seconds
Originally I sized the £0.18 slice at 5.8× so you’d keep a little spare liability for R4. But if you’re happy to throw your whole £20 at Knapp over the weekend, here’s the pure “use‑up‑all‑your‑available‑margin” calculation:

Current cash free = £10.28

Odds = 5.8× ⇒ liability per £1 stake = 5.8 – 1 = 4.8

Stake to use all £10.28

10.28

£
stake= 
4.8
10.28
​
 ≈2.14£
New liability = 2.14 × 4.8 ≈ £10.28

existing £9.40 gives £19.68, which is effectively your full £20 bank.

So if you want to risk your entire £20 this morning, place a lay of about £2.14 at 5.8× on Knapp.

This pushes your total exposure right up to your £20 test‑bankroll and ignores any reserve for R4.

You said:
No I'm not happy to bet everything on knapp. What i'm trying to establish is what is the optimal size to place another lay bet on knapp that leaves me with capital to place more lays at r4 but assuming i can lose the £20 over the course of the weekend. 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11 seconds
Here’s the simple way to think about “optimal” sizing when you’ve got two more lays to fire (R3 now, then R4 tomorrow), and you want to spread your £20 test‑bankroll across both rounds:

1. Decide how to split your bankroll
A common rule is to keep 50/50 between the two remaining lays:

£10 liability for your R3 lay

£10 liability reserved for your R4 lay

You already have £9.40 of liability on Knapp (0.5 @ 7.2× + 1 @ 8.0×). So to bring your total R3 liability up to £10, you need £0.60 more.

2. Calculate the additional stake at today’s odds
Current best lay odds: 5.8×

Liability per £1 stake = 5.8 – 1 = 4.8

To add £0.60 of liability:

Stake
  
=
  
0.60
4.8
  
≈
  
£
0.125
Stake= 
4.8
0.60
​
 ≈£0.125
So:

Place a lay of £0.13 (≈£0.125) at 5.8×.

New liability ≈ 0.13×4.8 = £0.62

Total R3 liability → 9.40 + 0.62 ≈ £10.02

Leaves you ~£9.98 of your £20 for the R4 lay.

If you’d rather allocate differently…
60/40 split (60% R3, 40% R4):

Target R3 liability = 0.6×20 = £12

Additional liability needed = 12 – 9.40 = £2.60

Stake = 2.60/4.8 ≈ £0.54

Any other ratio:

Compute your target R3 liability = ratio×£20

Subtract existing £9.40 ⇒ Δ_liab

Stake = Δ_liab / 4.8

But if you just want a straight 50/50 split, go with that £0.13 lay at 5.8× this morning. That way you still have roughly half your test‑bankroll in reserve for the final round.

You said:
is keeping half the bankroll for the remaining round the ideal, would that have a bigger edge potentially
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Splitting your test‑bankroll 50/50 between R3 and R4 is a perfectly reasonable rule‑of‑thumb, but it isn’t the “ideal” from an EV‑maximization standpoint—because it ignores the fact that your per‑round edge and variance profile will almost certainly differ.

Why 50/50 is just a heuristic
Simplicity: it guarantees you always have ammo left for the last round.

Even pacing: smooths out your risk so you don’t go bust in R3.

But it treats both lays as if they had the same EV per £ of liability, which usually isn’t true.

Sizing for maximum EV: the Kelly perspective
The mathematically optimal stake on each lay is proportional to

f
∗
  
=
  
p

  = your model’s win‑prob,

p

t
=

/
O
p

​
 =1/O = market’s implied prob,

O
O = lay odds.

That fraction 
f
∗
f 
∗
  is the Kelly fraction: the % of your bankroll you should risk on that bet to maximize long‑term growth.

t
=
0.172
⇒p 
mkt
​
 =0.172, edge = 0.14–0.172=–0.032 (negative ⇒ you wouldn’t lay).

If it were positive (say edge=+0.05), then

f
∗
=
0.05
5.8
−
1
≈
0.0104
  
=

 of bankroll.
f 
∗
 = 
5.8−1
0.05
​
 ≈0.0104=1.04% of bankroll.
End of R3 example:

Odds around 4.7–8, p_final typically > p_mkt by, say, 0.06 ⇒

f
∗
≈
0.06
5
−
1
≈
1.5
%
 
.
f 
∗
 ≈ 
5−1
0.06
​
 ≈1.5%.
So rather than pre‑committing half your bank to R3, you’d look at the Kelly % for the current edge and size accordingly—letting you naturally allocate more to the round with higher “edge / (O−1)” and less where it’s weaker.

A practical compromise
Compute Kelly% each time: auto‑size your lay (or a fraction of Kelly if you want to dampen volatility)

Reserve only what you need: if R3’s Kelly says 3% of bank, you lay 3% now and keep 97% for R4 (subject to that round’s own Kelly).

Cap your total: you might still cap aggregate exposure (e.g. never risk > 20% of your test bank on one golf match), but let the split float based on edge.

TL;DR
50/50 split is simple and safe—but it can leave EV on the table if R3 and R4 edges differ materially.

Kelly sizing automatically gives you the “ideal” split: each lay stake = Kelly % × bank.

In practice, calculate

f

and apply those fractions (or a half‑Kelly if you want to be conservative).

That will maximize your weekend EV while still letting you test out the full £20 over both rounds.

Yes–that “£73” liability is exactly what your code spits out on a ½‑Kelly sizing. Here’s the math:

Edge = Market p − Model p ≈ 0.1695−0.0973 = 0.0722 (7.22 %)

Odds–1 = 5.9−1 = 4.9

Full‑Kelly liability = Bankroll × Edge / (Odds−1)

≈
£
147
=10 000×0.0722/4.9≈£147
½‑Kelly liability (your code) = 0.5×147 ≈ £73

And your “Lay Stake ≈ £15” follows because stake×4.9 ≈ £73.

If you feel that’s too conservative:
Use full Kelly by setting KELLY_FRACTION = 1.0.
That would double your liability to ~£147 (stake ~£30) on Knapp.

Or pick another fraction (say 0.75) to land in between.

½‑Kelly is a common risk‑control choice to cut variance in half. If you’re happy to run bigger swings in your £10 000 test bank, bump that fraction up.

½‑Kelly ⇒ 0.5×147 ≈ £73 liability (so a £15 stake at 5.9×)

From a pure long‑run EV standpoint, full Kelly maximizes growth, so you’d actually be staking ~£30 at 5.9× (to risk £147). But full Kelly carries huge volatility—half‑Kelly is the classic EV‑optimal compromise, cutting your variance in half while still capturing most of the growth benefit.

If you’re truly focusing only on EV (and can stomach the swings), you could raise KELLY_FRACTION toward 1.0. But if you want steadier growth with lower drawdowns, 0.5 (yielding that ~£73 liability) is exactly what I’d expect.

 =10000×0.0722/4.9≈147 £ liability (≈1.47 % of bank)

Your code then halved that (½‑Kelly) to £73.

Why so “small” for a 7 % edge?
Because at 5.9× the market is offering you 4.9 “units” of liability for every £1 staked. Even though you believe you’re 7 % underpriced, the Kelly formula divides that by 4.9 to prevent over‑leveraging on a single high‑odds event.

If you backed a 2× bet with 7 % edge, full Kelly would say stake ~3.5 % of your bank (0.07 / (2−1) = 7 %).

But at 5.9×, you’re effectively risking 4.9 units to win 1, so your fractional bet is 0.0722 / 4.9 ≈ 1.47 %.

So, is it “too conservative”?
From a pure EV‑maximization standpoint, you’d go full‑Kelly (£147 liability, ~£30 stake) to capture every bit of that 7 % edge.

From a risk‑management view, ½‑Kelly (your £73 liability) reins in drawdowns at the cost of a bit less long‑run growth.

If you’re comfortable with the volatility and truly want “all‐in” on that edge, set KELLY_FRACTION = 1.0 in your code and you’ll get the ~£147 liability recommendation.

originally when i placed the back bet to hedge against knapp it was around 10.2 now his odds have to continue to come the hedge is around 8.65 what do i do, leave the hedge where it was or put it where it now is or somewhere in between?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5 seconds
You’ve already locked in a back at 10.2 to hedge part of your lay, and now the “fair” lay price (where pₘₖₜ = p_final) has moved in to about 8.65. Here’s how to think about updating your hedge:

1. Why you’d want to hedge at 8.65 now
Fair odds (8.65×) are where your model thinks the true value lies.

By hedging at 8.65, you lock in exactly the model‑implied profit on whatever open liability you still have.

If you leave your hedge solely at 10.2, you’re exposed on the portion you didn’t cover—if Knapp keeps drifting in, you give back EV.

2. What to do with your existing hedge at 10.2
Keep it. You’d only pay commission if you tried to cancel a matched bet, and you’ve already secured that slice of profit at 10.2.

3. How to hedge the rest
Calculate your remaining lay liability on Knapp (your total lay liability minus whatever that 10.2 back covers).

Place a new back for that remaining liability at 8.65×.

This way:

The portion you hedged at 10.2 stays locked in at that price.

The unhedged slice is now covered at model‑fair odds (8.65), locking in the correct exposure without overpaying.

If you really want one “average” hedge price
You could cancel both back orders (incurring commission) and re‑lay the entire liability at 8.65, giving you a single hedge price—but that eats into your profit and isn’t necessary.

TL;DR
Don’t cancel your 10.2 hedge.

Add a back at 8.65 to cover whatever liability remains unhedged.

You’ll then be fully locked‑in at model‑fair value across your whole position.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11 seconds
First, let’s get your numbers straight (from the “Compare” pop‑up):

Total lay liability on Knapp: £73.66

Recommended hedge % (holes left =36, odds=5.9) = 60 %

Fair (model‑implied) odds = 8.74

You currently have no matched back at 10.2, so that order never hit. You want to replace it now at a sensible price. Here are your two clean options:

A) Hedge at model‑fair odds (8.74×)
Locks in exactly 60 % of your remaining lay‐liability at the price your model says is “fair.”

Hedge liability = 0.60 × £73.66 = £44.20

Back stake = hedge_liability ÷ (fair_odds − 1)

Place a back of ~£5.70 at 8.74×.

B) Hedge now at the live market (5.9×)
Locks in the same 60 % of liability but at the current best price.

Hedge liability = £44.20 (same as above)

Back stake = 44.20 ÷ (5.9 − 1)

44.20

≈
£
9.02
= 
4.90
44.20

Place a back of ~£9.00 at 5.9×.

Which to choose?
(A) at 8.74 leaves you fully “fair‑locked” by your own model.

(B) at 5.9 gives up some extra EV (since 5.9 < 8.74) but ensures immediate execution.

If you’re comfortable waiting for the 8.74 level to fill, go with option (A). If you want the hedge done instantly, use (B).

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
First off, you’ll want to kill that stale 10.2× order (it never matched, so it’s just clutter). Then, recompute your hedge at the new model‑fair price of 8.65×.

1. Figure out your current lay liability
From the matched lays at 5.8, 7.2 and 8.0 your P&L window shows a total liability of about £10.84.

2. Decide how much to hedge
Your code’s “Lay Hedge %” is still 60 %, so you’d cover:

Hedge liability

10.84

6.50

That will:

Lock in 60 % of your liability at your model’s “fair” price.

Leave the remaining 40 % unhedged to carry into R4.

If you’d rather hedge 100% now
Just divide your full £10.84 liability by (8.65−1):

10.84

7.65
  
≈
  
£
1.42
10.84/7.65≈£1.42
Back £1.42 at 8.65× to fully neutralize the position at model‑fair.

If you need an immediate fill at the best live odds (≈5.9×)
You can do the same maths using 5.9 instead of 8.65, but you’ll give up some EV:

Back ~£1.33 at 5.9× to hedge 60% immediately.

TL;DR

Cancel the unmatched 10.2× order.

Back ~£0.85 at 8.65× to hedge 60% of your £10.84 liability at your model’s fair price.

Leave the rest unhedged for R4.

jake knapp i've curently staked 1.80, isn't 60% of this 1.08?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5 seconds
The confusion is that the “60%” hedge recommendation applies to liability, not to the raw stake. You have indeed laid a total of £1.80 in stakes across three bets, but those three stakes carry very different liabilities:

Odds	Stake	Liability = Stake×(Odds–1)
5.8×	£0.30	0.30×4.8 = £1.44
7.2×	£0.50	0.50×6.2 = £3.10
8.0×	£1.00	1.00×7.0 = £7.00
Total stake = 1.80	Total liability = 1.44+3.10+7.00 = £11.54
(Your Betfair UI is showing £10.84 liability, which may reflect a slightly different stake mix or a small cash‐out adjustment. But the principle is the same.)

– 60 % of your liability is

0.60
×
11.54
≈
£
6.92
0.60×11.54≈£6.92
– To hedge £6.92 of liability at your fair odds (≈ 8.74×), the back‑stake is

So you should place a back of about £0.90 at 8.74× to cover 60 % of your money at risk.

In short: you don’t take 60 % of your 1.80 stake; you take 60 % of your liability, then convert that back into a stake at the hedge odds.

explain this in easier terms
ChatGPT said:
Let’s break it down without jargon—think of two different piles of money:

What you’ve actually put up (“stakes”): £0.30 + £0.50 + £1.00 = £1.80

What you stand to lose if Knapp wins (“liability”):

At 5.8×, your £0.30 stake risks £1.44

At 7.2×, your £0.50 risks £3.10

At 8.0×, your £1.00 risks £7.00

Total liability = £1.44 + £3.10 + £7.00 = £11.54

Why hedge % applies to the liability (£11.54), not the stakes (£1.80)
The “60% hedge” means “cover 60% of what you could lose, not 60% of what you’ve bet.”

60% of £11.54 = £6.92: that’s the chunk of potential loss you want to lock down.

Turning that £6.92 into a back‑stake
To lock in £6.92 of cover at your fair odds (≈ 8.74×), you figure out:

Back stake

(

​
 ≈

​
 ≈£0.90
So you’d place a back of about £0.90 at 8.74×, which:

Costs you £0.90 up front

Gives you the right to win back £6.92 if Knapp does win

That £6.92 exactly cancels 60% of your £11.54 at‑risk

TL;DR
Calculate your total liability (sum of each stake×(odds–1)).

Take 60% of that liability → the amount you want to cover.

Divide by (hedge odds–1) to get the back‑stake.

That’s why you don’t just do 60%×£1.80, but instead 60%×£11.54, which leads to a back‑stake of about £0.90 at 8.74×.

does it matter that i've now laid 2 golfers which has reduced the liabiity on both, look at market with the green and red numbers under each golfer, or do you just calculate it on the lay bet at the time it was placed 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
The short answer is: each lay gets its own hedge calculation, based solely on that lay’s current liability, not on how many other lays you’ve got on or on the little green/red numbers you see under the names (those are just market depth / available size at each price).

What really matters for your hedge:
Your current liability on that one golfer

Liability
=
Stake
×
(
Lay odds
−
1
)
.
Liability=Stake×(Lay odds−1).
If you’ve laid multiple bets on the same golfer, sum their liabilities to get your total at‑risk.

Your target hedge % (e.g. 60%):

Liability to cover
=
0.60
×
(
Total liability on that golfer
)
.
Liability to cover=0.60×(Total liability on that golfer).
The odds at which you want to hedge (your “fair” price):

Back‑stake
=
Liability to cover
Hedge odds
−
1
.
Back‑stake= 
Hedge odds−1
Liability to cover
​
 .
What the green/red numbers mean
They’re market liquidity (how much other people are willing to match at each price), not your liability or P&L.

You only need enough depth to fill your back order, but they don’t feed into the math.

TL;DR
Ignore the green/red “available” numbers for sizing.

Always calculate your hedge on the current total liability you have on that golfer, multiplied by your chosen hedge %.

Convert that covered‐liability into a back us­ing

Place a lay order “above” that break‑even (e.g. your 8–15× bracket end‑R2, 4.5–8× end‑R3). This ensures it’s a +EV conditional order.

If that order doesn’t get matched by the time you go to bed, cancel it and re‑run the model in the UK morning (5 h before the next round). Odds will have shifted; decide then whether a fresh +EV lay still exists and re‑place your conditional order at the new break‑even.

If your lay does get matched, congratulations—you’re in a +EV position. Now:

Monitor overnight: if the market drifts out (odds lengthen beyond your entry), you can add another lay slice at the same logic (always sizing by your Kelly or bankroll split).

If it tightens, just carry your matched position through; you never back off a +EV lay.

This way you:

Never sit on stale negative‑EV orders.

Lock in +EV lays whenever they become available (round by round).

Give yourself a chance to layer up if the market keeps drifting in your favor.

  comes out to 7.3×

You decide to place a +EV conditional lay at 7.4× (just above break‑even)

Scenario A: Your 7.4× lay goes unmatched before you sleep
Market drifts out to, say, 8.2× overnight

Your 7.4× order never filled.

In the UK morning, re‑run the model.

Now p_final is unchanged, so break‑even is still 7.3×.

Odds are 8.2× > 7.3× ⇒ a new +EV opportunity.

Action: Cancel the stale 7.4× order and place a fresh lay at, say, 8.3× or another level just above break‑even.

Market tightens to 7.0× overnight

7.0× < 7.3× ⇒ no +EV opportunity any more.

Action: Cancel the 7.4× order; do not lay at 7.0× (that’d be negative EV).

Check again later (maybe the market drifts back out), but don’t force it.

Scenario B: Your 7.4× lay gets matched immediately
You now have a live lay at 7.4×. Two possible paths:

Market drifts out to 8.5× before R3

You’re sitting on a +EV position and the market is even kinder to you.

Option to add: run your sizing logic (Kelly or fixed split) on the new edge at 8.5× and place an additional lay slice at, say, 8.6×.

Or simply hold the existing lay and wait for R3 results.

Market tightens to 6.0× before R3

Odds have shortened below your entry. You’ve effectively “lost” some EV, but you still believe p_final > 1/6.0 (i.e. it remains +EV) because you wouldn’t have laid in the first place if it were stale.

Action: Do nothing—carry the matched lay through.

If it tightens all the way to your cash‑out target or below break‑even, check again if you want to hedge or lock in profit, but you don’t cancel a +EV lay.

Quick reference
Event	Odds move →	Unmatched order?	Matched lay?	Action
Market drifts out	↑ to >7.4	Wait & re‑price in AM	Add another slice	Place new conditional lay above new BE
Market drifts in	↓ to <7.4	Cancel	Hold	Do not lay tighter, carry existing
Order never matches by AM	—	Re‑run model	—	Cancel stale, place fresh at new BE
That framework—place conditional lay above break‑even, cancel if it never hits and re‑evaluate, add to matched positions if market drifts out, hold if market drifts in—lets you systematically capture every bit of +EV without ever sitting on a stale or negative‑EV order.

Compare that edge to your 3 % “add” threshold:

If

edge>3%, you can place an additional lay at 6.0× (size it per your Kelly or bankroll‑split rule).

If 
edge
≤
3
%
edge≤3%, do nothing—the incremental EV isn’t worth the risk.

Concrete example
Morning p_final → 20 %

Implied p_mkt at 6.0× → 1/6.0 ≈ 16.67 %

Edge → 20 % − 16.67 % = 3.33 % ✅ above 3 %
→ you would add a fresh lay slice at 6.0×

But if p_final had stayed at, say, 15 %:

Edge → 15 % − 16.67 % = –1.67 % or at best below 3 %
→ you wouldn’t add; you’d just carry the 7.4× lay through.

TL;DR

Do re‑run the model on the morning odds.

Only add if that recalculated edge exceeds your 3 % cutoff.

Otherwise, hold the matched 7.4× lay and wait for R3 play.

This converts your open lay into a flat, hedged position.

You’ll realize whatever loss you’ve accrued up to now, but you’ll stop any further bleed.

2.00
10/(6.0−1)=10/5=£2.00.

Place Back £2.00 @ 6.0×. That fully neutralizes your lay and locks in your loss.

Bottom line: whenever your model shows no edge (or a negative edge), the EV‑optimal play is to close the position rather than hope for a reversal.

Why this is best EV long‑term
You never carry a negative‑EV slice, so you stop losses.

You layer in more size precisely when the model still gives you a healthy edge, capturing every bit of value.

Sizing by Kelly (or a conservative fraction of it) is the mathematically optimal growth strategy, balancing EV and risk.

That clear, disciplined cycle—re‑run, compute edge, hold/add/close—is the key to locking in maximum expected value over the long run.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
You don’t need a special “add” fraction on top of your 50%‑Kelly—just treat each fresh slice exactly the same way you treated your original bet:

Recompute the fresh edge vs the new odds.

Compute the full‑Kelly:

f
∗
  
=
  
edge
O
−
1
f

O−1
edge
​
 
Apply your chosen fraction (e.g. 50%) to that 
f
∗
f 
∗
 . That gives you the stake size for this addition.

Why this makes sense long‑term
Consistency: By always using the same fraction, you’re always capturing the same proportion of the available EV while capping your volatility at exactly the level you chose.

Geometric growth: Fractional Kelly (½‑Kelly, ¼‑Kelly, whatever) scales down the full‑Kelly optimum to a point on the risk/return trade‑off curve. If you pick 50% once, that’s your risk budget for every +EV bet—whether it’s your first slice or your third.

No “double‑dipping”: If you tried to use 50% on your first bet and then 50% of the remainder on your second, you’re actually laddering your risk twice (and your total volatility balloons). Instead, each bet gets its own 50%‑Kelly sizing from the current bankroll.

So…
If you normally run ½‑Kelly, then each time you add you still size at 50% × (full‑Kelly) for that new edge/odds.

If that feels too volatile, drop your global fraction to 25% (or 10%!) and apply that uniformly.

For pure EV growth (maximizing geometric return), you’d run full Kelly (100%), but that comes with deep drawdowns.

In short, pick your Kelly fraction up front based on how much variance you can stomach—and then use that same fraction on every slice, initial or add‑on, for the best long‑term trade‑off of growth vs. risk.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9 seconds
You want to treat every new price level as a fresh +EV opportunity—but without obsessively refreshing every minute or chasing tiny moves. Here’s a simple, practical cadence that balances capturing EV with avoiding over‑trading:

1. Trigger by “significant” drift, not the clock
Rather than checking every 5 mins, pick a drift threshold—say 0.5× in the odds (or ~10 % relative change). From your 7.4× entry:

7.4→7.0 (−0.4) is just under threshold ⇒ you can skip re‑running.

7.4→6.6 (−0.8, >0.5) is significant ⇒ you re‑run the model and consider adding.

6.6→6.4 (−0.2) is small again ⇒ you ignore it until the next 0.5× move or your next scheduled check.

This way you only re‑run when the market’s moved enough to matter.

2. Scheduled “safety‑net” checks
On top of drift triggers, pick two scheduled times to be sure you don’t miss anything:

Morning snapshot (~5 h before next round).

1 h pre‑round (when the book “goes in‑play”).

Even if the market hasn’t moved by 0.5×, those are your back‑ups to catch any stale orders or new +EV spots.

3. Adding a slice when you do re‑run
Whenever you re‑run (either at a drift trigger or at one of the two “safety‑net” times):

Recompute 
p
f
i
n
a
l
p 
final
​
  with the latest holes‑left, shot‑diff, etc.

Calculate the new edge vs the current odds.

If edge > your add‑threshold (e.g. 3 %),

Size the fresh slice via your usual Kelly fraction (½‑Kelly if that’s your norm).

Place the new lay at the prevailing odds.

If edge ≤ 3 %, do nothing—hold what you’ve got (or close if edge flipped negative).

Putting it all together
End‑R2: you lay at 7.4×.

Market drifts to 7.0 (<0.5× change) → no action.

Market drifts further to 6.6 (>0.5× total drift) → re‑run & add if edge > 3 %.

Market drifts to 6.4 (<0.5× from 6.6) → no action.

Morning → re‑run again, and add if edge > 3 %.

1 h before R3 → final re‑run & add if still a +EV spot.

That way you:

Capture the big drifts without chasing every tick.

Guarantee at least two safety checks before play resumes.

Only add when your model still shows a material edge, keeping your long‑run EV optimal.

You said:
if the edge is >0% but <3% do nothing if >3% add if <0% fully hedge and close for a loss?
ChatGPT said:

Yes—that’s exactly the three‑zone rule we’ve been using:

Edge < 0 % ⇒ Fully hedge/close the lay to lock in the loss.

0 % ≤ Edge < 3 % ⇒ Hold your existing lay, but do not add any more.

Edge ≥ 3 % ⇒ Add a fresh lay slice (size via your chosen Kelly fraction).

How to apply it

You said:
why 3%
ChatGPT said:
The 3 % cutoff is purely a practical buffer—it isn’t sacred, but it ticks three key boxes:

Covers commission and slippage
– Your back/lay round‐trip costs you around 2 % in betting exchange commission alone.
– Add in a bit of price‐movement risk (“slippage”) between when you decide and when you hit the button, and you need at least a 3 % gross edge just to clear into net profitability.

Filters out noise
– Small edges (e.g. 0.5 % or 1 %) live and die on tiny model or market fluctuations.
– By waiting for ≥ 3 %, you focus only on material mispricings that have a high chance of actually persisting to execution.

Reduces over‑trading
– If you tried to add on every 0.5 % uptick you’d be actioning dozens of tiny bets, each eating fees and burning time.
– A 3 % bar means you only add on moves that promise a meaningful EV boost relative to your operational cost.

Can you adjust it?
Absolutely—if you have ultra‑low fees or very fast execution you might tighten the bar to 2 %, or conversely raise it to 4 % if you want extra safety. The key is to pick a threshold that:

Exceeds your round‑trip cost (commissions + slippage)

Is large enough to stand out of the noise

Matches your trading cadence (you don’t want a dozen micro‑bets per day)

That way, every “add” you make truly moves the EV needle.

You said:
what offers the best long term ev % to use as a threshold
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Your “add” threshold should really be set just above your true transaction cost — i.e. the sum of commission, slippage and any market‑impact — so that every layer you place is positive‑EV after all costs. Here’s how to think about it:

Measure your round‑trip cost

Exchange commission: typically ~2 % on net winnings.

Slippage/market‑impact: maybe 0.2–0.5 % on average, depending on how fast you execute and market liquidity.

Total cost: ≈ 2.2–2.5 %.

Set your threshold just above that

If you pick 2 %, you’ll essentially be break‑even after fees.

At 2.5 %, you clear commission + slippage on average.

At 3 %, you give yourself a small buffer so only the most robust edges get traded.

Understand the trade‑off

Lower threshold (2–2.5 %) → more frequent “add” opportunities, higher gross EV, but more noise and more trades near your edge‑cost line.

Higher threshold (3–4 %) → fewer trades, each one carries a cleaner net EV, but you may skip some legitimately profitable layers.

Long‑term EV implication
Optimal long‑run growth happens when your threshold ≈ your true cost. Any higher, and you leave free money on the table; any lower, and you risk trading losses.

In practice, because your model and market both have wiggle, adding a cushion of +0.5 % to +1 % above cost (making 3–3.5 %) often yields the best realized EV after slippage and fees.

Recommendation:

If your effective cost is ~2.3 %, try a 2.5 % threshold to start.

Monitor your fill‑rates, realized slippage and net P&L per slice.

Tune up or down (e.g. toward 3 % if you’re over‑trading small edges, or toward 2 % if you’re leaving too much on the table).

That way, you anchor your “add” rule to real costs, maximizing net EV over the long run.

You said:
consider above 3% above 4% and above 5% which is the best for long term growth
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
It really comes down to the trade‑off between how much gross EV you capture and how often you get to trade. Raising your “add” bar from 3 % → 4 % → 5 % will:

✅ Increase average edge per layer
— at 3 % you’ll pick up a lot of small 3–5 % edges; at 5 % you only ever trade the rare 5 %+ mispricings.

❌ Decrease frequency of layers
— fewer opportunities clear that higher bar, so you compound your leftover bankroll more slowly.

If we think in Kelly growth terms, your long–run growth rate is roughly

 ×average edge per bet
where 
f

f

  is your Kelly fraction. As you raise your edge threshold:

Average edge up

Number of bets (hence total stake over time) down

Empirically (and in theory), the sweet‑spot is usually just above your true cost (≈2.3 %). That means:

3 % threshold: you net about 0.7 % gross EV per layer after costs, and you get to layer quite often → highest total growth.

4 % threshold: you net ~1.7 % EV per layer but maybe 30–50 % fewer layers → growth falls a bit below the 3 % case.

5 % threshold: you net ~2.7 % but only a trickle of trades → total compounded growth is even lower.

Rule of thumb
3 %: maximal growth, a little noisier and more operational work.

4 %: moderate growth, lower turnover and lower slippage risk.

5 %: very conservative, minimal trading but you’re likely leaving most EV on the table.

Bottom line: if your execution is reasonably tight, go with ≥ 3 % as your add threshold to maximize long‑term EV. Bumping it up to 4 % cuts variance and workload at the cost of ~10–15 % of your total EV; going all the way to 5 % is usually too conservative for pure growth.

great thanks. turning to a spreadbetting uk account, i have £2000 and hold a diversified portfolio of gold, oil, spx and bonds. What % of my account should be used in margin to allow for drawdowns and avoiding margin calls
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
A good rule of thumb in spread‑betting (or any margin‑based trading) is to keep your total margin utilization well below the point at which usual market swings could trigger a margin call. With a £2 000 account and a diversified book (Gold, Oil, SPX, Bonds), you might aim for:

Risk Profile	Max Margin Usage	Free Margin Buffer
Conservative	20 % (£400)	80 % (£1 600)
Balanced	30 % (£600)	70 % (£1 400)
Aggressive	40 % (£800)	60 % (£1 200)
Why leave 60–80 % free?
Volatility cushions

Oil and gold can swing 3–5 % in a day, SPX 1–2 %, bonds less so.

If your margin is 30 %, a 10 % adverse move could wipe out half your usable equity—so you want plenty of headroom.

Avoiding margin calls

Brokers often require a maintenance margin of ~30–50 % of your initial margin.

If you already used 40 % of your equity as margin and the market moves against you, you’ll be into maintenance territory fast.

Flexibility to add or hedge

A big buffer lets you add to winners or hedge losers without immediately breaching your maintenance requirement.

How to size by instrument
You don’t have to slice it evenly. Weight by each market’s volatility & your conviction:

Gold (relatively stable): 5–10 % of account

Oil (high volatility): 5–8 %

SPX (medium volatility): 10–12 %

Bonds (low volatility): 3–5 %

That might total ~30 % of your account in margin, leaving ~70 % free to absorb shocks.

Putting it into practice
Decide your total margin cap (e.g. 30 % = £600).

Allocate per market based on its risk (as above).

Monitor your free margin in real time—if it drops below ~25 %, consider reducing size or hedging.

Rebalance if one market “eats” more margin (e.g. oil spikes), to get back under your cap.

By keeping your initial margin usage in the 20–30 % range and always monitoring free margin, you’ll have the best chance to ride out normal drawdowns without ever touching a margin call.

at 20% and we get a covid crash would i get a margin call
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
You won’t automatically get a margin call just because “we hit a COVID‑style crash”—it all comes down to how big your drawdown is versus your free margin and what maintenance‑margin level your broker enforces. Here’s the simplest way to see it:

1. How margin usage moves in a crash
Account equity starts at £2 000.

You use 20 % of that as initial margin (≈£400), leaving £1 600 free.

If your positions go down by X % in a crash, your equity falls to

2000
×
(
1
−
X
%
)
.
2000×(1−X%).
Your margin requirement (the £400) usually stays the same until you reduce or close positions.

So your new margin usage becomes

400
2000
×
(
1
−
X
%
)
.
2000×(1−X%)
400
​
 .
Crash %	Equity (£)	Margin usage = 400/Equity
10 %	1800	22.2 %
20 %	1600	25.0 %
30 %	1400	28.6 %
40 %	1200	33.3 %
50 %	1000	40.0 %
60 %	800	50.0 %
70 %	600	66.7 %
2. Where the margin call threshold sits
Most brokers will send a margin call if your margin usage creeps above their maintenance requirement—often 30–50 % of your equity.

If your broker’s maintenance is 35%, you’d only get called when margin usage > 35%.

In the table above, that happens once your equity has fallen by about 43 %.

3. Conclusion for “20% initial usage”
A 30% crash (like early COVID) pushes you to ~28.6% usage → still below a typical 35% call line.

Even a 40% crash keeps you at ~33% → just under the call line.

You’d only hit a call if your portfolio lost roughly 45–50% (usage → 36–40%) or more, or if your broker’s maintenance margin is particularly tight.

Practical take‑aways
20% initial margin gives you a comfortable buffer against most historic crashes.

Check your broker’s exact maintenance margin—if it’s 25% then a 30% crash would already trigger a call.

If you want to be ultra‑safe—even against a >50% tail event—drop your usage to 10–15% so you don’t get called until an extreme >70% drawdown.

But in most cases, 20% usage means you’d survive a COVID‑style 30–40% sell‑off without a margin call.

However, your short call doesn’t carry a cash‐margin requirement in the same way as your spread bets—it’s backed by collateral rather than margin, so we can exclude it when sizing for a margin call. If you strip out the call, your pure spread‑bet margin falls to about 28% of equity.

— At 28% you’re well below the 50% closure threshold, so even a very sharp “COVID‑style” crash won’t trigger a margin call unless you lose roughly 45–50% of your account in one move.

Bottom line: with your spreads only using about 28% of equity, you have a comfortable buffer against margin calls even in extreme market moves—no need to pull back size further unless you want an even bigger safety cushion.

help i think i've calulated the hedge on sam stevens wrong

Thought for 4 seconds
Let’s walk through it one more time, step by step, to show why 0.31 is indeed the correct amount:

Your existing lay on Sam

Lay odds = 12.5×

Lay stake = 0.90 £

Liability = 0.90 × (12.5 − 1) = 0.90 × 11.5 = £10.35

60% of that liability

0.60 × 10.35 = £6.21

Convert that £6.21 back to a back‑stake at fair odds (21.0×)

Each £1 you back at 21.0× wins you £20 if Sam Stevens wins.

You need a stake S such that:

S × (21.0 − 1) = £6.21

⇒ S = 6.21 / 20 ≈ 0.31 £

If you enter Back 0.31 £ @ 21.0× → profit = 0.31 × 20 = £6.20, which exactly offsets 60% of your £10.35 lay‑liability.

So 0.31 £ is the right size. If you’d instead backed any other number, you’d either under‑hedge (leaving more risk than 60%) or over‑hedge (locking in less than 60% profit).

can you check the knapp trades too is that the right hedge size

Let’s double‑check Jake’s hedge the same way we did Sam’s:

Compute your total lay liability on Knapp

0.30 @ 5.8× → 0.30×(5.8–1) = £1.44

0.50 @ 7.2× → 0.50×(7.2–1) = £3.10

1.00 @ 8.0× → 1.00×(8.0–1) = £7.00

Total liability = 1.44 + 3.10 + 7.00 = £11.54

60 % of that liability

0.60
×
11.54
=
£
6.92
0.60×11.54=£6.92
Convert to a back‑stake at your fair odds (~8.8×)

0.89
 
£
Stake= 
8.8−1

​
 =

6.92
​
 ≈0.89 £
So a £0.90 back at 8.8× perfectly covers 60 % of your £11.54 at‑risk.

Your 0.9 £ stake at 8.8× is exactly right for a 60 % hedge on the Knapp lays.

Thought for a few seconds
Your hedge‑sizing function is returning the liability to cover, but you’re sticking that straight into the “stake” column—so you’re under‑hedging by a factor of (odds−1).

In other words, this…

df["LayHedgePct"]   = df.apply(lambda r:
    recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay") if r.LayLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
…computes

LayHedgeStake
=
LayLiability
×
HedgePct
LayHedgeStake=LayLiability×HedgePct
which is in £ liability units, not in £ stake units.

The correct math
Liability to hedge

L

g
e

​
 =LayLiability×HedgePct
Convert that into a back‑stake at your hedge odds 
O

O

BackStake=

How to fix your code
Replace those two lines in compare_golfers() with something like:

# liability we want to cover
df["LayHedgePct"]       = df.apply(
    lambda r: recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
              if r.LayLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
df["LayHedgeLiability"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct

# actual back‐stake needed to lock in that liability
df["LayHedgeStake"]     = df.apply(
    lambda r: r.LayHedgeLiability / (r.LiveOdds - 1) if r.LayHedgeLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
LayHedgeLiability is how much of your original lay you want to neutralize.

LayHedgeStake is the £ stake you actually place in the back market.

With that tweak, your hedge sizing will match the examples we walked through.

You said:
why am i not hedging 60% of the stake
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Because your three lays all carry very different levels of “at risk” money (liability) even though the raw stakes sum to £1.80, hedging “60% of the stake” wouldn’t actually offset 60% of your risk. What you really care about is covering 60% of your total liability:

Liability ≠ stake

A £1 lay at 8× risks £7 of your own cash,

Whereas a £0.30 lay at 5.8× only risks £1.44.

You want to neutralize 60% of the liability, not 60% of the sum of your stakes.

Total liability = £11.54 (from your three lays).

60% of that is £6.92.

Convert liability to back‑stake at your hedge odds 
O
O:

BackStake
=
0.60
×
Liability
O
−
1
.
BackStake= 
O−1
0.60×Liability
​
 .
That gives you about £0.89 at 8.8× for Knapp, or £0.31 at 21× for Stevens.

If you simply did “0.60×£1.80” = £1.08 of back‑stake, you’d only neutralize a fraction of your true risk and leave most of your liability un‑hedged. That’s why the code applies the hedge % to your liability column and then re‑computes the correct back‑stake.

You said:
no ignore the 3 lays, just generally why am i not hedging 60% of stake
ChatGPT said:
Because in a lay bet your risk isn’t the raw stake you put up—it’s the liability (stake × (odds–1)) that you stand to lose if the golfer wins.

Stake is just how much you put down; liability is how much you actually lose on a win.

A 60 % hedge means you want to neutralize 60 % of your risk—so you take 60 % of your liability and then convert that back into whatever stake you need at the hedge odds.

If you instead hedged 60 % of your stakes, you’d often under‑ or over‑hedge:

On a high odds lay, 60 % of the stake only covers a small fraction of your true risk.

On a low odds lay, 60 % of the stake might cover more than 60 % of the risk.

By applying your percentage to the liability column, then dividing by (hedge odds–1) to get a stake, you lock down exactly the fraction of your real exposure you intended.

You said:
what is my code currently doing, i want dymanic hedging not always 60%
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Right now your code is doing static, rule‑based hedging:

In recommended_hedge_pct(odds, holes_left, direction) you pick one of a handful of fixed percentages (90%, 60%, 50%, or 12.5%) based solely on the live odds and holes remaining.

You then do

df["LayHedgePct"]   = recommended_hedge_pct(...)
df["LayHedgeLiab"]  = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayHedgeLiab / (df.LiveOdds - 1)
so you always hedge that same “banded” percentage of your liability, no matter how big or small the edge is.

Toward a truly dynamic hedge
Instead of “always 60%,” you can make your hedge size a function of your current edge:

Calculate your edge for each row:

edge
=
p
f
i
n
a
l
−
p
m

Define a mapping from edge → hedge %

e.g.

# pseudo‑code
if edge <= 0:        hedge_pct = 0.0    # no hedge, or full hedge if negative EV
elif edge < 0.03:    hedge_pct = 0.0    # skip weak edges
else:                hedge_pct = min(1.0, edge / 0.10)
Here you’d only hedge when edge ≥ 3%, and you’d scale up linearly so that a 10% edge would call for a 100% hedge.

Or you could tie it directly to your Kelly fraction:

hedge_pct
=
edge
O
−
1
×
HEDGE_FACTOR
hedge_pct= 
O−1
edge
​
 ×HEDGE_FACTOR
giving you a fraction of your liability proportional to the optimal Kelly stake.

Plug that into your DataFrame instead of the static recommended_hedge_pct:

def dynamic_hedge_pct(row):
    edge = row.Edge
    odds = row.LiveOdds
    if edge <= 0:
        return 1.0    # full hedge to close a negative EV lay
    if edge < 0.03:
        return 0.0    # no hedge on small edges
    # otherwise scale hedging between 0% and 100% as edge goes from 3% to 15%
    return min(1.0, (edge - 0.03) / (0.15 - 0.03))

df["LayHedgePct"] = df.apply(dynamic_hedge_pct, axis=1)
df["LayHedgeLiab"]  = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayHedgeLiab / (df.LiveOdds - 1)
Why this helps long‑term EV
No more one‑size‑fits‑all: you only hedge the amount that your model says is worth it.

Edge sensitivity: larger edges → larger hedge (locking in more profit); marginal edges → smaller or no hedge.

Negative‑EV protection: if edge flips negative, you automatically flip to a full hedge/close.

Plug something like the above into your compare_golfers() and you’ll have dynamic, edge‑driven hedging instead of always 60%.

but it's not always 60% now, what is wrong with the way it's currently being calculated
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8 seconds
Your code is doing two things you didn’t intend:

Using static “banded” percentages instead of sizing the hedge from your current edge, and

Treating that percent as a stake, not as a percent of your liability.

1. Hedge % comes from recommended_hedge_pct, not your edge
df["LayHedgePct"] = df.apply(lambda r:
    recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay") if r.LayLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
That function returns 0.90, 0.60, 0.50, 0.675 or 0.125 based on odds & holes left—so it will not always be 60%.

If you want a dynamic hedge you need to replace it with something like:

def dynamic_hedge_pct(r):
    edge = r.Edge
    if edge <= 0:    return 1.0    # full hedge on negative EV
    if edge < 0.03:  return 0.0    # no hedge on small edges
    return min(1.0, edge / 0.10)   # scale up to 100% as edge→10%
df["LayHedgePct"] = df.apply(dynamic_hedge_pct, axis=1)
That way your hedge percent is driven by your model’s edge, not a hard‑coded band.

2. You’re multiplying liability by the pct and calling it “stake”
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
That gives you the liability you want to cover, not the stake you need to place. To turn a liability into a back‑stake you must divide by (odds – 1):

# liability you want to cover
df["LayHedgeLiability"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct

# correct back‑stake in £ at the market odds
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.apply(
    lambda r: r.LayHedgeLiability / (r.LiveOdds - 1) if r.LayHedgeLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
In summary
Replace recommended_hedge_pct with a function that sizes by your edge if you want truly dynamic hedging.

Then compute LayHedgeLiability = LayLiability * LayHedgePct and
LayHedgeStake = LayHedgeLiability / (LiveOdds - 1)
so you actually get the right stake in the market rather than a raw liability figure.

You said:
i'm confused, are you saying the way the hedge is currently being calculated is wrong and will lead me to lose money over time
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Your code isn’t actually placing the back‑stake that corresponds to “60% of your risk” (or whatever dynamic % you end up with); it’s simply multiplying that percent by your liability and calling the result your “stake.”

What it’s doing today
df["LayHedgePct"]   = …  # e.g. 0.60 for a 60% hedge
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
LayLiability is “how much you stand to lose” if the golfer wins.

LayHedgeStake therefore ends up being “60% of that” in £ liability—but it’s labeled (and later treated) as if it were the £ stake.

In reality, to achieve a 60% hedge you need:

Compute the £ liability you want to cover:

L
h
e
d
g
e
=
LayLiability
×
0.60
L 
hedge
​
 =LayLiability×0.60
Convert that liability into the back‑stake you actually submit at odds 
O
O:

BackStake
=
L
h
e
d
g
e
O
−
1
BackStake= 
O−1
L 
hedge
​
 
​
 
Because you never do step 2, you’re over‑betting your hedge if your code sends LayHedgeStake straight to the market, and under‑hedging if you try to interpret it as liability. Either way, the mismatch will steadily erode your EV (and could even turn positive‑EV lays into net losses once you factor in commission and slippage).

Will it make you lose over time?
Yes: mis‑sizing your hedge means you’re not actually locking in the fraction of profit or loss you think you are.

Under‑hedging (placing a smaller back than needed) leaves you with residual risk.

Over‑hedging (placing a bigger back than needed) turns winning lays into losing hedges.

Both scenarios systematically bleed value from your strategy.

The fix
Replace:

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
With:

df["LayHedgeLiability"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
df["LayHedgeStake"]     = df.LayHedgeLiability / (df.LiveOdds - 1)
That ensures the stake you place in the market actually offsets the exact fraction of your risk you intended. Then your hedges will behave exactly as you model them—and your long‑term EV will actually be positive.

You said:
ok do not change anything else in the code at all but i want you to fix only the hedging rules as discussed for the dynamic version. i need the entire code in a code block
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
I’ve replaced the static hedge bands with a dynamic hedging function driven by your model’s edge, and corrected the liability → stake conversion so each hedge now exactly offsets the intended risk. Everything else in your script is untouched. Let me know if you’d like to tweak the edge thresholds or scaling!

no i asked you to use a code block not canvas do it in a code block

which of the two images do you think is the better hedge
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Between those two, the first image is the correct “better” hedge for a negative‐EV lay:

In the top screenshot you see Lay Hedge % = 100% and a small back‑stake (~£0.31) that exactly neutralizes your entire lay liability.

In the bottom screenshot you only hedged 60%, leaving a 40% chunk of negative‑EV on the table.

Because Knapp’s edge is now negative, you want to fully hedge (100%) to close out the position rather than only cover 60%. The first image does exactly that; the second one under‑hedges.

You said:
no this is incorrect, a negative edge is GOOD for laying, if the edge was + i'd want to back
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
You’re absolutely right: for a lay, a negative edge (model p_final < market p_mkt) is what you want, so you don’t hedge that. It’s only when the edge flips positive (model thinks the player is underpriced by the market) that your lay becomes negative‑EV and you should fully hedge.

So your dynamic_hedge_pct should be:

def dynamic_hedge_pct(r):
    edge = r.Edge
    if edge <= -0.03:
        # strong negative‐EV for the back, i.e. strong +EV for the lay => no hedge
        return 0.0
    if edge < 0:
        # slight negative‐EV on backing (slight +EV for lay) => still hold
        return 0.0
    # at this point edge >= 0: your lay is now negative‐EV => hedge it
    return 1.0
Which you can simplify to:

def dynamic_hedge_pct(r):
    # hedge *only* when edge >= 0 (i.e. lay is negative‑EV)
    return 1.0 if r.Edge >= 0 else 0.0
With that change, you’ll only ever hedge (i.e. back to close) when the lay has become negative‑EV.

You said:
I think you've fucked this up now. is that still going to dynamically hedge?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Yes—you still have a dynamic hedge. The function

def dynamic_hedge_pct(r):
    # only hedge when the lay has flipped to negative‐EV
    return 1.0 if r.Edge >= 0 else 0.0
runs per golfer every time you hit Compare Entered Golfers(), looks at that row’s current Edge and:

If Edge < 0 (model p_final < market implied ⇒ positive‑EV lay) → returns 0.0 → no hedge

If Edge ≥ 0 (model thinks the lay is now negative‑EV) → returns 1.0 → 100% hedge

So it’s still fully dynamic—each time you refresh it will automatically decide, for each golfer, whether to hold the lay or fully close it.

You said:
Right i need the entire code, full code, as per the tweak with the dynamic hedging now that you know that a negative edge is GOOD FOR LAYING

now there's no hedge at all?????????????????????????????
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
The fact that Lay Hedge % is now 0% is exactly what your new dynamic rule says to do: you only hedge (i.e. back to close) when Edge ≥ 0 (meaning your lay has gone negative‑EV). In this screenshot:

Edge = –6.77% (p_final < 1/odds) ⇒ your lay is still positive‑EV, so the code correctly returns 0.0 for LayHedgePct and shows no hedge.

If you’d rather put on a small partial hedge even when the lay is +EV, you’ll need to tweak dynamic_hedge_pct. For example, if you want to always hedge at least, say, 30% of liability:

def dynamic_hedge_pct(r):
    if r.Edge < 0:
        return 0.3   # always hedge 30% even on +EV lays
    else:
        return 1.0   # fully hedge when edge flips ≥0
But as written, the code is doing exactly what you told it: no hedge whenever edge < 0.

You said:
no you've fucked this up big time. The idea as per the orignial code is that there is ALWAYS a hedge of some sort but should be based on ev and stage of the match, sometimes this might be low 25%, sometimes it might be 50% sometimes it might be 100%. As soon as the ev goes positive i fully hedge to limit losses, however the partial hedge is to make profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Configuration & Globals
Constants for your model (slopes, floors, blend weights, total holes, commission, fraction of Kelly you use, etc.)

A global list, golfer_rows, to hold each golfer’s latest live metrics and computed probabilities.

2. Monte Carlo Win‐Prob (simulate_win_prob)
Given:

The player’s current shots‑ahead/behind (shots_diff),

Holes remaining,

Projected strokes‑gained for the rest of the tournament,

Field strength and simulation parameters,

It simulates thousands of random tournament outcomes (you vs. the rest) and returns the empirical win probability.

3. Single‐Golfer Score & Probability (calculate_score)
When you click “Calculate Score & EV”:

Read all inputs from the right‑hand GUI (SG components, shots, finishes, leaderboard position, etc.).

Compute a raw “score” that blends historical and live stats, with a penalty if the golfer is “imbalanced” (too much putting vs. other SG).

Convert that score via a logistic to a heuristic probability (p_model).

Project forward to recompute strokes‑gained remaining, run the Monte Carlo for a simulated probability (p_sim).

Blend the two (25% heuristic + 75% sim) into final win‐prob p_final, then apply a small “fragility” haircut if their putting share is >30%.

Floor/ceiling it to [2%, 25%] and compute:

Market implied probability (1/live odds)

Edge = model – market

Fair odds (and a blended “fair” vs. current odds)

Lay EV if you were to lay at the current market odds

Store or update that golfer’s row in golfer_rows.

4. Dynamic Hedging Rule
Two functions control your hedge sizing:

recommended_hedge_pct: your original “banded” rule (25%–90%) based on odds and holes left.

dynamic_hedge_pct: wraps that base rule but overrides to 100% whenever your edge ≥ 0 (i.e. the lay has turned negative‑EV and you want to close out fully).

5. Compare & Hedge Popup (compare_golfers)
When you click “Compare Entered Golfers”:

Build a DataFrame from golfer_rows.

Compute, for each golfer:

Lay liability via your 50%‑Kelly sizing formula (only if edge < –3 pts threshold).

Lay stake = liability/(odds–1).

Apply dynamic hedging:

Get LayHedgePct from dynamic_hedge_pct.

Compute liability to hedge = LayLiability×LayHedgePct.

Convert that into a back‑stake = hedge‑liability/(odds–1).

Display everything in a scrollable ttk.Treeview with columns:
Name, Model %, Mkt %, Edge %, Fair, Odds, Lay Stake, Lay Liab,
Lay Hedge £, Lay Hedge %, RankProb, RankEdge.

In practice
Before your lay has turned profit‑making (edge < 0), you get a partial hedge (25–90%) per your banded rule—locking in some profit.

As soon as your model says the lay is no longer +EV (edge ≥ 0), the code switches to 100% hedge, closing the position to limit losses.

Let me know if you’d like any part of that drilled into more detail!

You said:
no tell me how the hedge portion works in this new code
ChatGPT said:
Here’s exactly what’s happening, step by step, once you click Compare Entered Golfers and hit the hedging section:

You already have a lay position sized (LayLiability/LayStake) via your Kelly‐based formula.

Pick a “base” hedge % from your original banded rule:

base = recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
That returns something like 0.60 (60%) or 0.50 (50%) depending on the golfer’s live odds and holes remaining.

Override if the lay has gone negative‑EV (i.e. market odds now imply a win‑prob > your model’s):

if r.Edge >= 0:
    # model says the lay is now unprofitable → close it fully
    hedge_pct = 1.0
else:
    # lay is still +EV → keep your base partial hedge
    hedge_pct = base
Compute how much of your risk you want to neutralize:

LayHedgeLiability = LayLiability * hedge_pct
→ e.g. if you risk £10 total and hedge_pct=0.6, you’re covering £6 of liability.

Convert that liability back into a back‑stake at the current market odds (LiveOdds):

LayHedgeStake = LayHedgeLiability / (LiveOdds - 1)
→ that’s the £ amount you actually send to the back ladder.

Display LayHedge£ and LayHedge% alongside the rest of the table.

In plain English:

While your lay is still +EV, you always lock in a partial profit by hedging a fixed “base” percentage of your liability (say 50–60%).

The moment your model says the market has underpriced the golfer (Edge ≥ 0), you flip to a 100% hedge and close the position completely, capping any further loss.

That two‑tier dynamic (partial‑hedge vs full‑hedge on “Edge”) is how the new code both captures running profits and limits losses automatically.

You said:
no explain the logic
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the step‑by‑step decision logic behind the hedging in that compare_golfers():

Start with your existing lay liability

You’ve already sized your lay via Kelly (or your fixed rule) and you know LayLiability (the £ you stand to lose if the golfer wins).

Compute a “base” hedge percentage

base = recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
This is your original banded rule (25%, 50%, 60%, 90% etc.), designed to lock in part of your running profit while the lay is still +EV.

Check the current edge

if r.Edge >= 0:
    # The market has caught up: your lay is now *negative*‐EV
    hedge_pct = 1.0    # fully close the position
else:
    # You still have a +EV lay
    hedge_pct = base   # only a partial hedge
r.Edge = model’s p_final − market implied.

Edge < 0 means “model thinks this lay is +EV”—you want to keep the position, but lock in some of the gain.

Edge ≥ 0 means “model says the lay is no longer +EV”—you want to exit fully to stop any further losses.

Translate that percentage into a back‑stake

hedge_liab = LayLiability * hedge_pct
back_stake = hedge_liab / (LiveOdds - 1)
hedge_liab is “how much of your risk you want to neutralize.”

Dividing by (odds − 1) converts that into the actual £ stake you submit on the back side to lock in that fraction of liability.

Show both % and £ in the pop‑up

LayHedge % is simply hedge_pct * 100.

LayHedge £ is the back_stake you’d place.

In plain English
While the lay remains +EV (your model still beats the market):
• You partial‑hedge at whatever banded percentage you defined (e.g. 60%) to lock in some profit.

As soon as the market “catches up” or moves against you (edge flips ≥ 0):
• You flip to a 100% hedge—i.e. you back the entire lay liability and close the trade to cap your loss.

That two‑tier approach—partial while +EV, full when non‑EV—is the “dynamic hedging” logic baked into your code.

You said:
no this is wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Okay, here’s the pure decision‐tree behind every hedge calculation in that pop‑up, with no code — just logic:

Always start with a “base” hedge percentage

This is your original rule (25 %, 50 %, 60 %, 90 %, etc.) chosen by looking at the current odds and holes remaining.

It’s the fraction of your risk you lock in while your lay is still +EV (i.e. the model thinks you’re getting a good price).

Check your live “edge”

Edge = model win‑prob – market implied win‑prob.

Edge < 0 ⇒ your lay is positive EV (good for the lay).

Edge ≥ 0 ⇒ your lay has turned negative EV (bad for the lay).

Decide hedge %

If Edge < 0 (lay is still +EV): use the base % to lock in some profit.

If Edge ≥ 0 (lay has gone negative EV): switch to 100% — fully hedge (i.e. close) to stop further loss.

Convert that % into a back‑stake

Compute liability to cover = total lay‐liability × hedge‐%.

Then stake = liability_to_cover ÷ (odds – 1).

That stake is what you send as a back bet to implement exactly that fraction of hedge.

In plain English:

While you’re still “winning” the lay, you always lock in a partial hedge (your chosen band).

The moment your model says the market has priced you out (edge≥0), you flip to a full hedge and get out.

That’s the dynamic logic: partial hedges when the lay is +EV, full hedge when it’s not.

Thought for a few seconds
In the snippet you posted, everything under “HEDGE PERCENT FUNCTION” and the three lines in compare_golfers() is doing exactly this:

Decide a fixed “base” % via your original banded rule, completely ignoring edge:

recommended_hedge_pct(odds, holes_left, "lay")
– e.g. 90% if odds ≤2.5, 60% if odds ≤8.0, etc.

Apply that % to your total lay liability (not your stake) to get “LayHedgePct” and then immediately treat it as a stake:

df["LayHedgePct"]   = base_pct
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
– so if you have £10 of liability and base_pct = 0.6, it will set LayHedgeStake = £10 * 0.6 = £6

Display “Lay Hedge %” and “Lay Hedge £” in the table, but that “£” column is really 60% of your liability, not the back‑stake you’d need to place.

In other words:

You’re always hedging a pure percentage of your liability based only on odds & holes left.

You’re mis‑labeling “LayHedgeStake” (it’s in liability‐units, not the true £‑stake to submit in the market).

There’s no dynamic adjustment for whether the lay is still +EV or has flipped negative‐EV—edge doesn’t enter into this at all.

That’s why you’re seeing a static % and a £ number that doesn’t line up with the actual back‑stake you need.

i'm not seeing a static number at all it works fine, all i want to fix is the % you said it's not hedging on liability

The only thing the hedge part is doing is:

Picking a “base” percentage entirely from your static banded rule

df["LayHedgePct"] = df.apply(lambda r:
    recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
    if r.LayLiability>0 else 0, axis=1)
No edge‑check, no dynamic sizing—just “if odds ≤2.5 → 90%, elif ≤8.0 → 60%,” etc.

Applying that percentage directly to your liability

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
If you have £10 of liability and LayHedgePct is 0.6, it sets LayHedgeStake = £6 (i.e. 60% of your liability).

Displaying that “LayHedgePct” and the raw “LayHedgeStake” (which is really just that share of liability, not the actual market‐stake you’d need).

So in plain English:

Hedge % = “what fraction of your exposure you want to lock in,” chosen by a fixed rule on odds & holes left.

Hedge £ = exactly that fraction of your liability, with no further conversion.

It is, in fact, hedging on liability—but then labelling that liability‑figure as your “stake,” which is why the back‑stake doesn’t line up with what you expect in the market.

that is the fucking stake, it's the stake i have to back at to hedge. I don't know what youre saying anymore

Here’s exactly what your hedge code is doing, line by line, once you hit Compare Entered Golfers:

Compute your lay liability (the £ you stand to lose if the golfer wins) via your Kelly rule:

df["LayLiability"] = df.apply(_lay_liab, axis=1)
Compute your lay stake at the market odds:

df["LayStake"] = df.LayLiability / (df.LiveOdds - 1)
Pick a hedge percentage from your original banded rule (no edge involved here):

df["LayHedgePct"] = recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
– e.g. 0.60 if odds ≤ 8.0, 0.50 if ≤ 4.0 with lots of holes, etc.

Calculate the back‐stake you’d place to lock in that fraction of your liability:

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
In plain terms:

If you risk £10 of liability and your band says “60%,” it sets LayHedgeStake = £10 × 0.6 = £6.

That £6 is shown in the “Lay Hedge £” column as the amount you’d back at the same LiveOdds to offset 60% of your risk.

Show the percentage and the calculated stake:

df["LayHedgePctDisplay"] = df.LayHedgePct.apply(lambda x: f"{int(x*100)}%")
So: the hedge logic is simply
Always take that static, bucketed percentage from recommended_hedge_pct

Multiply your total lay liability by it

Use that product as your back‑stake to hedge

There’s no adjustment for changes in edge or odds—the percentage is fixed by odds/holes, and stake = liability × that percentage.

You said:
so the code currently, computes how many holes are left and the odds of the player, then it's working out the lay liability and recomending a hedge % called stake based on the liability of the player
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Exactly right. Here’s the flow in plain steps:

Determine Lay Liability

LayLiability = KellyFraction * Bankroll * (Market_p – Model_p) / (LiveOdds–1)
(if that liability passes your edge‑floor filter)

Pick a Hedge % via your original banded rule

HedgePct = recommended_hedge_pct(LiveOdds, holes_left, "lay")
(e.g. 60% if odds ≤ 8.0, 50% if odds ≤ 4.0 with plenty of holes, etc.)

Compute the Back‐Stake to lock in that fraction of your risk:

LayHedgeStake = LayLiability × HedgePct
That “Lay Hedge £” is exactly the amount you’d place as a back bet at the same LiveOdds to cover HedgePct of your liability.

So yes—the code looks at holes left and odds to decide a static “Hedge %,” then multiplies that by your current lay liability to produce the stake you should back.

That snippet in your compare_golfers() does exactly three things:

Chooses a “base” hedge % purely from the static banded rule:

recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay")
– e.g. 90% if odds ≤ 2.5, 60% if odds ≤ 8.0, etc.
– It does not look at your current edge at all—only the live odds and holes remaining.

Applies that % to your total lay‑liability:

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
– If you stand to lose £10 in liability and the rule says 60%, you’ll get LayHedgeStake = £6.
– That “£6” is presented as the stake you should back at the same market odds to offset (hedge) that portion of your risk.

Displays the percentage and the calculated stake:

df["LayHedgePctDisplay"] = df.LayHedgePct.apply(lambda x: f"{int(x*100)}%")
In short: hedge % = a fixed bucket based on odds/holes, and hedge £ = that % × your liability. There’s no conversion by (odds−1), no check of whether your edge is still +EV, and no dynamic resizing based on profit or loss—just a straight liability×percentage.

tell me how the hot putter logic works
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
The “hot‑putter” adjustment is just a way to penalize cases where a golfer’s strokes‑gained putting makes up an unusually large share of their total strokes‑gained. The idea is that putting performance is much noisier (i.e. “hot” or “cold” streaks) than tee‑to‑green or approach, so you don’t want your model overweighting a putting streak that may evaporate.

How it works in code
Compute total strokes‑gained across all four facets

total_sg = abs(sg_off_tee) 
         + abs(sg_approach) 
         + abs(sg_putting) 
         + abs(sg_around_green)
Calculate putting share

putt_share = abs(sg_putting) / max(total_sg, 1e-8)
This is “what fraction of your total SG this golfer’s putting represents.”

Compare against a baseline of 30%

If putt_share ≤ 30%, no penalty.

If putt_share > 30%, they’re “overly reliant” on putting.

Scale a penalty from 0→20% as putting share goes from 30%→100%:

fragility = (putt_share – 0.30) / 0.70 * 0.20
At 30% share → (0.30–0.30)/0.70*0.20 = 0% penalty.

At 100% → (1.00–0.30)/0.70*0.20 = 20% penalty.

Reduce the blended win‑prob by that fraction:

p_final = max(P_FLOOR, p_final * (1 – fragility))
So if fragility=10%, you multiply your win probability by 0.90, knocking it down 10 %.

Why this matters
Prevents over‑reliance on a hot putter—a streak in putting often regresses.

Keeps your model honest: if someone has +3 SG putting but only +0.2 SG elsewhere, you don’t want to treat them as a top contender.

Caps the damage: you’ll never cut more than 20% off your probability, so you still respect a truly dominant player.

That’s the “hot‑putter” or fragility logic in a nutshell.

my code always says a leader with strokes ahead is always value to back never lay
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12 seconds
Your code’s lay‐sizing function is gating every potential lay by a hard 3 % edge threshold, and since leaders with a stroke advantage almost always have model p_final ≥ market p_mkt, they never clear that bar. Here’s exactly why:

Edge is computed as

edge = p_final − p_mkt
For a leader, p_final (your model’s win‐prob) tends to be higher than p_mkt (the market’s implied win‐prob).

That makes edge > 0.

In your _lay_liab(r) helper you immediately bail out unless

-r.Edge * 100 ≥ EDGE_FLOOR_LAY
where EDGE_FLOOR_LAY = 3.0.

Rewrite: you only consider lays when

−
edge
×
100
  
≥
  
3.0
⟺
edge
  
≤
  
−
0.03
−edge×100≥3.0⟺edge≤−0.03
That means the model’s win‐prob must be at least 3 percentage‐points below the market’s, i.e. a big negative edge, before any lay liability is even computed.

Since a leader almost never has

p
f
i
n
a
l
  
≤
  
p
m
k
t
−
0.03
p 
final
​
 ≤p 
mkt
​
 −0.03
(they’re usually better than the market thinks), the code does

if -r.Edge*100 < EDGE_FLOOR_LAY:
    return 0.0
and you get zero lay liability.

In plain English:

You’ve told the program “only lay if the market is at least 3 % too optimistic about this golfer.”

A leader with a stroke margin is almost always priced ≤3 % too pessimistically by the market, so you never hit that trigger—and the code always suggests backing (positive edge) rather than laying.

If you want to allow some small lays on leaders (e.g. when your model thinks the market is just a hair too bullish), you’ll need to lower or remove that 3 % threshold (EDGE_FLOOR_LAY), or change the _lay_liab guard so that you lay whenever edge < 0 rather than edge ≤ -0.03.

lets say i've laid a golfer at 8.2 on end of r3 he's now at 23.0 but when i run the stats he's value to bak, should i hedge or leave

Thought for a few seconds
Since your model now flips to “value to back” at 23.0, your lay has become negative‑EV, so the EV‑optimal move is to fully hedge (i.e. close) that lay. Here’s how you do it:

Compute your lay liability

L
=
LayStake
  
×
  
(
  
8.2
−
1
)
 
.
L=LayStake×(8.2−1).
(If you laid, say, £1 at 8.2, then 
L
=
1
×
7.2
=
£
7.20
L=1×7.2=£7.20.)

Calculate the back‑stake at the new odds (23.0) needed to neutralize that liability:

BackStake
=
L
23.0
−
1
=
7.20
22
≈
£
0.33
BackStake= 
23.0−1
L
​
 = 
22
7.20
​
 ≈£0.33
So you place Back £0.33 @ 23.0×.

That fully offsets your £7.20 liability, locking in whatever P&L you’ve made or lost up to now, and stops any further EV bleed.

You said:
and long term that's better than leaving them?
ChatGPT said:
Yes. Any time your lay flips into a back‑value spot, you’re sitting on a negative‑EV position from that point on—holding it only bleeds value over time.

Hedging (fully closing) realizes whatever small profit or loss you’ve already locked in and prevents the model’s “value to back” view from eating into your stake.

Leaving a negative‑EV lay just means you’re continuously fighting the market edge, eroding your bankroll.

So long‑term, the EV‑optimal move is to hedge out as soon as the model says “value to back,” rather than hope for a reversal.

You said:
what do you think to the long term viability of making consistent gains with this approach assuming I don't do anything to it
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Your lay-only framework—with a blended model, Monte Carlo sims, imbalance/fragility penalties, and dynamic, partial‐then‐full hedges—is a solid, risk-aware system. But “set it and forget it” will almost certainly undercut your long‐term gains. Here’s why:

1. Model edges will decay
Market efficiency: As you—and any other shrewd traders—trade off your edges, the market will adjust. Odds will compress, shrinking your gross edge over time.

Stale parameters: Your logistic (a, b), Monte Carlo σ, fragility thresholds, SG weights, etc., were tuned on past data. Courses change, fields change, players change: without periodic retraining or recalibration, your model’s predictive accuracy will drift downward.

2. Costs & slippage accumulate
Commission & fees (~2% per round-trip) and slippage erode small edges fast.

Your system assumes clean fills at quoted prices; in practice you’ll get partial fills, need to chase liquidity, and sometimes burn through queues.

3. Over-hedging vs. under-hedging trade-off
Partial hedges lock in profit but reduce your exposure to favorable moves.

Full hedges cap losses but prevent you from catching a late reversal.

Static band thresholds (25–90%) may not stay optimal as your edge distribution and volatility regime shifts.

4. Risk of “black swans”
Golf tournaments see weather delays, withdrawals, or dominant runs that your sim’s σ = 2.4 per 18 holes may not capture.

A string of longshots or a runaway favorite can blow wide your P&L curve, even with hedges in place.

5. Psychological & operational drift
Without ongoing monitoring, you may override cold-alerts (“this player is due”) or chase noisy signals.

The temptation to tweak hedges, thresholds or sizing “just this once” can destroy the discipline that makes your system shine.

To preserve and grow your edge:
Regularly retrain & backtest your model on fresh data—update a, b; resample your Monte Carlo parameters; re-examine SG-component weights.

Track realized edge vs. expected: measure slippage, fill rates, and net ROI per layer to recalibrate your 3% add bar or hedge bands.

Automate drift detection: flag when your model’s hit‐rate or ROI falls below a threshold, so you know when it’s “time for a tune-up.”

Scale in & out dynamically: be ready to reduce bet sizes in thin fields or ramp up in big-field majors where your model historically outperforms.

Stress‐test hedging rules: simulate extreme moves (e.g. a player going from 20× to 4× in one session) to ensure your partial hedges don’t leave you over-exposed.

Bottom line
Viability: Yes—you can extract consistent gains in the short to medium term, thanks to your multifaceted edge.

Sustainability: Only if you actively maintain the system—calibrating inputs, monitoring performance metrics, and adapting your hedge/sizing logic as the market and game evolve.

“Do nothing” invites edge decay, cost drag, and eventual drawdowns. The best traders treat a model like a living strategy, not a static script.

You said:
what is my model's cut off for edge % before a lay is recommended
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Your code only sizes a lay when your model’s win‐probability falls at least 3 percentage‐points below the market’s implied probability. Concretely:

# in your lay‐sizing helper:
if -r.Edge*100 < EDGE_FLOOR_LAY:
    return 0.0
r.Edge = p_model − p_mkt

So -r.Edge*100 = (p_mkt − p_model)*100

EDGE_FLOOR_LAY = 3.0

This means you only recommend a lay if

(

edge=p 
model
​
 −p

​

In other words, the model requires at least a 3% negative edge (model thinks the player is ≥3 pts over-priced by the market) before it will put on a lay.

lets say i have find an edge at 2.16% but I feel like this is something I want to take on, without changing the code and just a manual point of view how should i approach this in terms of size, i don't ewant to code it because it's not always going to be done it's rare so i just want a quick and dirty manual way of calculating the risk on these
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15 seconds
Here’s the simplest “by-hand” sizing rule I’d use anytime you hit a small edge (say 2.16 %) and want to pull the trigger without touching your code:

1. Compute b = Odds − 1
If you’re laying at 8.2×, then

b
=
8.2
−
1
=
7.2.
b=8.2−1=7.2.
2. Compute full-Kelly fraction
For a back bet, Kelly says

f
∗
=
edge
b
.
f 
∗
 = 
b
edge
​
 .
Here

f
∗
=
2.16
%
7.2
≈
0.003
=
0.3
%
 of your bankroll.
f 
∗
 = 
7.2
2.16%
​
 ≈0.003=0.3% of your bankroll.
3. Dial it back to your comfort (½-Kelly or ¼-Kelly)
– ½-Kelly → stake ≈ 0.15% of bankroll
– ¼-Kelly → stake ≈ 0.075% of bankroll

Worked example (£2 000 bankroll, 2.16% edge at 8.2×)
b
=
7.2
b=7.2.

Full-Kelly 
f
∗
=
0.0216
/
7.2
≈
0.0030
f 
∗
 =0.0216/7.2≈0.0030 → 0.30% of £2000 = £6.

If you only want half-Kelly: £6×50% = £3

Or quarter-Kelly: £6×25% = £1.50

TL;DR
Stake ≈ (edge ÷ (odds–1)) × bankroll, then multiply by whatever Kelly fraction you prefer (½, ¼, etc.).

That gives you a quick, mathematically grounded size without ever touching the Python.

great, should i ever take a a lay where my model says the edge is + (remember i'm laying only so usually want - edge). What circumstances could i potentially want to lay someone with a + edge
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
In almost all cases you only want to lay when your model’s edge is negative (i.e. it thinks the market is too optimistic and you have a +EV lay). But there are a handful of situations where you might still choose to lay a golfer even though your model shows a small positive edge (i.e. “value to back”):

Portfolio/Hedge balance

If you’re heavily exposed—say you’ve backed five players in the same tournament and one of them is a massive favorite—laying a +EV “value to back” pick can help diversify your risk or reduce a lopsided exposure.

Essentially you’re not trading that one player’s EV, you’re trading your overall portfolio P&L profile.

Liquidity or execution concerns

If the market is ultra-thin at your model’s fair price and you risk being stuck half-matched at worse odds, you might take a small lay at slightly negative EV just to ensure you get in.

Better a tiny negative-EV fill than no position at all if you need to lay off risk quickly.

Special information not in the model

Weather changes (heavy rain forecast), a late withdrawal, injury news or a surprise tee-time shift that your SG-based model hasn’t yet incorporated.

Here you’re effectively doing a discretionary overlay: “My model says value to back, but I know the greens will be soaked tomorrow—so I’ll lay.”

Risk budgeting or bankroll preservation

If you’ve already got several live lays on big favorites, you may choose to lay a +EV pick at a small negative EV just to free up margin or preserve liquidity for bigger EV swings later.

Think of it like taking a small step back so you can stay in the game.

Tournament-specific correlation trades

In team or event-level props (e.g. Ryder Cup formats), sometimes laying an underdog (even at a mild negative EV) can hedge a larger correlated position you’ve taken elsewhere.

TL;DR
Generally: don’t lay when your model says the edge is positive—your long-term EV will suffer.
Exceptions: portfolio hedging, execution urgencies, material off-model information, or strategic risk-budget moves.

Use these sparingly—and always size them smaller than your core +EV lays, since you’re knowingly taking a slight disadvantage.

You said:
for this laying model i have (the main one not the new one for under 3%) what is best for long term ev full kelly or half?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
In pure geometric‐growth theory, full Kelly maximizes your long‐term expected bankroll growth rate. However, it comes with very high volatility and deep drawdowns—practically speaking, most bettors and traders use a fractional Kelly (½-Kelly, ¼-Kelly, etc.) because:

½-Kelly captures about 90–95% of full-Kelly’s long-run growth, but cuts your variance roughly in half and greatly reduces the risk of ruin.

Full-Kelly can swing ±50% in drawdowns under realistic odds distributions, which for many bankrolls is untenable.

Since your model already uses a 50% Kelly fraction in its sizing, you’re striking that classic balance: you keep the vast majority of the EV edge while smoothing out the P&L swings.

Recommendation: Stick with ½-Kelly (or even dial back to ¼-Kelly if you find drawdowns too sharp).

If you ever want to chase the very last sliver of EV and can stomach extreme variance—and you’re fully capitalized—then bump it to full-Kelly. But for robust, repeatable growth with manageable risk, ½-Kelly is the practical long-term winner.

You said:
for the one under 3% what is the recommended kelly sizing for this
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
For those “marginal” lays where the model shows an edge of 0 % < |edge| < 3 % (i.e. you’re just under your usual 3 % floor), you’re in a sweet‐spot of small EV that’s easily eaten by noise, commission and slippage. In that zone, you want to shrink your bet-size compared to your normal ½-Kelly.

How to size it by hand
Calculate the full-Kelly fraction as usual:

f
∗
  
=
  
∣
edge
∣
  
odds
−
1
  
f 
∗
 = 
odds−1
∣edge∣
​
 
Apply a small fractional-Kelly on top of that. For “under 3 %” edges I’d recommend ¼-Kelly (25%), or even ⅛-Kelly (12.5%) if you want extra safety.

stake
  
=
  
f
∗
×
bankroll
  
×
  
(0.25 or 0.125)
.
stake=f 
∗
 ×bankroll×(0.25 or 0.125).
Worked example
Bankroll = £2 000

Edge = 2.16 % ⇒ 0.0216

Lay odds = 8.2 ⇒ 
b
=
7.2
b=7.2

Full-Kelly:

f
∗
=
0.0216
7.2
≈
0.0030
 
(
0.30
%
)
f 
∗
 = 
7.2
0.0216
​
 ≈0.0030 (0.30%)
¼-Kelly:

0.0030
×
2
 
000
×
0.25
  
≈
  
£
1.50
0.0030×2000×0.25≈£1.50
⅛-Kelly:

0.0030
×
2
 
000
×
0.125
  
≈
  
£
0.75
0.0030×2000×0.125≈£0.75
Why ¼-Kelly (or ⅛-Kelly)?
Reduces variance when your edge is small and noisy.

Keeps you in the game even if you hit a string of bad luck.

Still captures most of the tiny EV these edges offer, without letting costs swamp you.

So: for edges < 3%, size at 25% (or even 12.5%) of your full-Kelly. That’s a quick, “dirty” manual fix that preserves your long-term growth while respecting the noise floor.

if the odds have moved down against me and i lay the same player a second time, for the back hedge do i keep the original and then add a second or move the higher hedge to in line with the new hedge
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
You should treat each lay slice as its own position and hedge it independently—don’t pull up your old back‐bet to “move” it, you’ll just pay more commission and risk slippage. Instead:

Leave your original back-hedge in place.
It locks in whatever fraction of that first liability you wanted.

When you place a second lay at the lower odds, calculate a fresh hedge for that new liability:

new_liability
=
new_lay_stake
×
(
old_odds
−
1
)
new_liability=new_lay_stake×(old_odds−1)
then

new_hedge_stake
=
new_liability
×
desired_hedge_pct
new_odds
−
1
new_hedge_stake= 
new_odds−1
new_liability×desired_hedge_pct
​
 
Lay that new back-stake at the new odds—so you end up with two back‐bets: one locking in your original hedge, one locking in your new hedge.

Why this is cleaner
Keeps each hedge matched to the liability it covers, so your P&L attribution stays crystal‐clear.

Avoids needless cancellations (and extra fees) on your old hedge.

Lets you size each slice exactly how you intended, even if your “desired hedge %” changes over time or by edge band.

If you really wanted to “re-center” everything at the new odds, you could cancel both back bets and place a single combined hedge sized against the total liability at the new price—but it’s almost always more costly than simply adding the second hedge.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
Let’s break each slice down and show what the back‐stake should be, assuming you wanted to hedge 100 % of each liability (if you were doing a full close) or some fraction of it.

1) Your two lay bets
Lay Odds	Lay Stake	Liability = Stake × (odds–1)
8.0	0.16	0.16 × 7.0 = £1.12
11.5	0.20	0.20 × 10.5 = £2.10
Total lay liability = £1.12 + £2.10 = £3.22

2) If you wanted to fully hedge each lay (100 %)
You need to place a back‐stake that will pay out exactly the liability if the golfer wins:

BackStake
=
Liability
BackOdds
−
1
BackStake= 
BackOdds−1
Liability
​
 
Lay slice	Liability	Back Odds	BackStake = Liability ÷ (odds–1)
0.16@ 8	£1.12	14.0	1.12 ÷ 13.0 ≈ 0.086
0.20@ 11.5	£2.10	16.5	2.10 ÷ 15.5 ≈ 0.135
So if you truly wanted to lock in (hedge) the entire liability on each slice, you’d back:

~£0.09 @ 14.0

~£0.14 @ 16.5

3) What you actually placed
You backed 0.10 @ 14 (instead of ~0.086): you’ve over-hedged that slice by ~0.014 (£0.014 × 13 = £0.18 extra payout).

You backed 0.66 @ 16.5 (instead of ~0.135): that’s 5× too much for that second slice (0.66 vs 0.135)!

4) If you only wanted a partial hedge (say 60 % of each lay)
Multiply each liability by 0.6, then divide by (odds–1):

Slice	Liab	60% of Liab	BackOdds	Stake = 0.6 × Liab ÷ (o–1)
0.16@ 8	£1.12	£0.672	14.0	0.672 ÷ 13.0 ≈ 0.052
0.20@ 11.5	£2.10	£1.26	16.5	1.26 ÷ 15.5 ≈ 0.081
So a 60 % hedge would be roughly:

£0.05 @ 14

£0.08 @ 16.5

In summary
Correct formula:

back_stake = (lay_stake * (lay_odds - 1) * hedge_pct) / (back_odds - 1)
You’ve been using

back_stake = lay_liability * hedge_pct
which is why your 0.66 and 0.10 stakes are so far off.

If you want to lock in exactly 100 % of each lay’s liability, use the numbers in section 2; for a 60 % hedge use section 3’s numbers.

You said:
no it' sonly 60% at this point
ChatGPT said:
Right—at a 60 % hedge you should size each back bet so it covers 60 % of the liability, not 100 %.

Here’s the math again:

Lay Odds	Lay Stake	Liability	60 % Liab	Back Odds	Back Stake = (0.6×Liab)/(BackOdds−1)
8.0	0.16	£1.12	£0.672	14.0	0.672 ÷ 13.0 ≈ 0.052
11.5	0.20	£2.10	£1.26	16.5	1.26 ÷ 15.5 ≈ 0.081
So your two hedges at 60 % should be roughly:

Back £0.05 @ 14.0

Back £0.08 @ 16.5

That locks in 60 % of each slice’s risk.

Thought for 4 seconds
The culprit is right here in your compare_golfers():

df["LayHedgePct"]   = df.apply(lambda r:
    recommended_hedge_pct(r.LiveOdds, r.holes_left, "lay") if r.LayLiability>0 else 0,
    axis=1
)
df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
You’re taking liability × percent and calling it your “stake”—but on Betfair a stake is how much you back, not how much you stand to lose. To convert “I want to cover X £ of liability” into “I need to back Y £ at odds O,” you must divide by (odds–1):

back_stake = (liability * hedge_pct) / (back_odds - 1)
You even wrote that helper:

def calc_hedge_back_stake(current_red, hedge_pct, back_odds):
    return (current_red * hedge_pct) / (back_odds - 1)
—but you never actually use it.

Fix
Replace:

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.LayLiability * df.LayHedgePct
with something like:

df["LayHedgeStake"] = df.apply(
    lambda r: calc_hedge_back_stake(r.LayLiability, r.LayHedgePct, r.LiveOdds),
    axis=1
)
That will correctly turn “£ of liability to hedge” into “£ to back” at your live odds, and your hedge amounts will line up with what you see in the market.

            int(r.RankProb),
            int(r.RankEdge)

What changed:

Removed the LayHedgeStake calculation altogether.

Dropped "LayHedgeStake" from the cols list and heading.

Kept "LayHedgePctDisplay" so you still see the percent to hedge.

You said:
what is that, i need the entire code, please don't change anything else other than removing the hedging element keeping the % visible

this is half kelly right?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Exactly—because KELLY_FRACTION is set to 0.50 in the config, your _lay_liab calculation is using half-Kelly sizing. If you wanted full-Kelly you’d bump that constant up to 1.0.

the issue i'm finding is sometimes the liablility is very low especially if i already have multiple golfers laid. what can i do to increase the liability somtimes? just suggst at this stage
ChatGPT said:
Here are a few levers you can pull when your calculated lay-liability comes out too small:

Bump up your Kelly fraction
Right now you’re sizing at 50 % Kelly (KELLY_FRACTION=0.5). If you raise that to, say, 0.75 or even 1.0, your liability (and thus stake) will scale up proportionally across the board.

Lower your edge threshold
You’re currently only putting on a lay when the model says you’ve got at least a 3 % edge (EDGE_FLOOR_LAY=3.0). Dropping that floor to 2 % or 1 % will open up more liability on “smaller” edges.

Enforce a minimum liability
Decide on a hard floor—e.g. never let liability below £5—then if the Kelly formula spits out £2, you automatically up-size to your £5 minimum. (You can do this in _lay_liab before returning.)

Layer in a flat-stake overlay
On top of your Kelly-sized lay, tack on a small fixed-£ overlay (e.g. +£1 or +£2) whenever liability < some threshold. That way you guarantee a minimum bite even on marginal edges.

Use “equal-liability” stakes across multiple golfers
If you’ve already got three small exposures, you could decide to top them all up so each one has (say) £10 liability—to keep your book balanced—by computing for each:

top_up = max(0, desired_liability - current_liability)
additional_stake = top_up / (lay_odds - 1)
and place that extra lay.

Pick one or combine a couple. For example, going to 75 % Kelly plus enforcing a £5 min liability floor will immediately boost those tiny-liability lays into something meaningful, without rewriting the rest of your model.

let's do option 4, let's also layer in % of account on top of kelly, what do you suggest for good ev
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
Here’s a simple recipe for Option 4—“flat‐stake overlay + %-of-account”—that will guarantee you always bite off at least some of the action even when pure Kelly spits back tiny liabilities:

1. Pick a minimum liability floor as a % of your bankroll
Let’s say you’re comfortable risking at least 1 % of your bankroll on any lay, even if Kelly only wants £2 on it.

For a £2 000 bankroll that’s £20 liability.

2. Compute your Kelly liability as usual
kelly_liab = KELLY_FRACTION * bankroll * (market_p - model_p) / (live_odds - 1)
3. Overlay the difference up to your floor
min_liab = 0.01 * bankroll   # 1% of your bankroll
liability = max(kelly_liab, min_liab)
Now you’ll never lay for less than 1 % of your bankroll.

4. Bonus: Tiered overlay size by edge %
If you want to scale up your minimum‐liability floor when your edge is larger, you can use something like:

Edge %	Floor liability (% of BK)
2 – 4 %	1 %
4 – 6 %	1.5 %
6 – 10 %	2 %
> 10 %	3 %
e = edge*100
if   e<4:  floor_pct=0.01
elif e<6:  floor_pct=0.015
elif e<10: floor_pct=0.02
else:      floor_pct=0.03

min_liab = floor_pct * bankroll
liability = max(kelly_liab, min_liab)
What EV threshold makes this worthwhile?
Absolute minimum edge: don’t even lay unless edge <= –1% (i.e. you’re at least 1% “ahead” on a lay).

Overlay only above: I’d suggest only bumping up to your floor once edge <= –3%.

Tiered activation:

If edge is between –1% and –3%, stick with pure Kelly.

Once edge <= –3%, enforce your 1% floor.

If edge <= –6%, switch to the 1.5 % or 2 % floor above.

That way you’re only layering on extra risk when you really have the statistical edge to justify it. Over the long run, adding that small enforced minimum bite when your edge is meaningfully negative (i.e. good for a lay) will bump your win‐rate without blowing up your volatility.
